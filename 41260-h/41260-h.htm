<br />Trespassers</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Are you awake, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the darkness of the cabin, Dan Carter stirred
drowsily, scarcely aware of the whispering voice
from the adjoining bunk.</p>
<p>Relaxed and comfortable, he lay a moment, listening
to the quiet, steady breathing of the five Cub
Scouts who shared the quarters.</p>
<p>Overhead, a splatter of rain pinged on the tin roof
of the cabin. Faster and faster came the droplets,
beating a tattoo on his sleep-drugged brain.</p>
<p>Rain! Rain! Always rain!</p>
<p>Since Midge Holloway&rsquo;s father had invited Den 2
of the Webster City Cub Scouts to camp overnight
in the riverside cabin at the rear of his residential
property, the weather hadn&rsquo;t given them a break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>This time, hearing his name whispered, the boy
sat up, pulling the blankets with him. In the darkness,
Sam Hatfield reached out to touch his hand.
An assistant Cubmaster of the citywide Pack, Sam
served as leader of Den 2 in which his son Fred
was an active Cub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear that rain, Dan? It&rsquo;s coming down hard
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look&rsquo;s as if we&rsquo;re in for another ugly day,&rdquo; Dan
admitted. He kept his voice low so as not to awaken
the other Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river&rsquo;s likely rising. Think I&rsquo;ll take a look at
the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swinging his long legs out of the bunk, the Cub
leader began to pull on his clothes. Dan enjoyed the
warm luxury of the blanket a moment longer, and
then with a shiver threw it off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; he volunteered.</p>
<p>The two dressed quietly so as not to disturb the
sleeping Cubs.</p>
<p>In the bunk above Dan&rsquo;s, Brad Wilber, the Den
Chief, rolled restlessly. By contrast, Chips Davis,
half his lean body protruding from a blanket, slept
peaceful as a babe. The other Cubs, Midge Holloway,
Red Suell, Fred Hatfield and Mack Tibbets,
were equally dead to the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>Sam stooped to tuck the blanket around Chips&rsquo;
exposed torso. Then, with slickers buttoned, he and
Dan went out into the night.</p>
<p>A gust of wind dashed rain into their faces, blotting
out a view of the Holloway house on the hill.
The area near the cabin had dissolved into a sea
of mud.</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s flashlight picked out the graveled path
which led to the dock.</p>
<p>During the night, the river steadily had risen. Fed
by rampant streams to the north, the swollen waters
gradually had nibbled away the sandy beach. The
boat, tied securely the night before, now pounded
against the dock on a slack rope.</p>
<p>While Dan retied it, Sam Hatfield pushed away a
floating log which had lodged against the dock
post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;River&rsquo;s up another four inches,&rdquo; he observed
gloomily. &ldquo;And now, more rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think we ought to call it quits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for the fellows to decide,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
replied. &ldquo;It was swell of Midge&rsquo;s father to let us use
this place. It&rsquo;s almost like having a regular camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs sure appreciate it. But they&rsquo;re fed up
with the weather. Another day of this and we&rsquo;ll be
sprouting webs on our feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your thought, Dan? Do we stick, or shall
we call enough&mdash;enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to be a quitter. It&rsquo;s easy enough to trot
home to our folks. I&rsquo;d say, let&rsquo;s hang on another day
the way we planned. Maybe the weather man will
give us a break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield in relief. &ldquo;I was hoping
you&rsquo;d say that, Dan. The question is, will the other
Cubs agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all good sports. If only we could swim
or hike, everything would be swell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t rain forever,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield cheerfully.
&ldquo;Fact is, it&rsquo;s slackening now. If the weather
clears, I may have an idea or two for stirring up a
little fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From experience, Dan knew that Sam Hatfield,
athletic director at Webster City High School, never
lacked ideas. For that matter, neither did Midge&rsquo;s
father, Burton Holloway, who was the organization&rsquo;s
official Den Dad.</p>
<p>The camp-out on Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s property at the
edge of Webster City had been planned as a climax
to the outdoor activities of the Den. Only the
weatherman, it seemed, had pulled a fast one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>The first glimmer of a gray, muggy dawn filtered
through the woodland as Dan and the Cub leader
climbed the slope to the log cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start a fire,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield volunteered.</p>
<p>Anticipating rain, the Cubs, before retiring, had
stored a good supply of birch bark, pine needles and
dry wood in a natural ravine shelter twenty yards
from the cabin.</p>
<p>Dan now helped Mr. Hatfield scrape the ground
bare of soggy leaves. Kindling the fire carefully, the
Cub leader soon had a cheerful blaze going which
began to radiate heat. Dan&rsquo;s spirits rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, the rain is quitting!&rdquo; he said jubilantly. &ldquo;And
here comes Midge&rsquo;s father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burton Holloway, a lean man of athletic build,
rapidly descended the stone steps from the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all invited to our place for breakfast,&rdquo; he
announced. &ldquo;Have a bad night of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we were snug and warm in the cabin,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield replied. &ldquo;As for breakfast, I don&rsquo;t think we
should impose on Mrs. Holloway. We&rsquo;ll make out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suit yourselves,&rdquo; the Den Dad smiled. &ldquo;Anyway,
tell the Cubs to come to the house for anything they
need.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>By the time the camp fire had burned down to
cherry red coals, the Cubs began to straggle from
the cabin. Chips Davis, a tall stripling for his eleven
years, was first to thrust his seal-like head out into
the cold mist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another lousy day,&rdquo; he bemoaned. &ldquo;Four of &rsquo;em
in a row. Great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pipe down and get busy,&rdquo; Dan growled. &ldquo;A Cub
is supposed to be game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, that&rsquo;s what it says in the manual. But the
wise guy who wrote that book was sitting at his typewriter
in a nice cozy room with steam heat and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pipe down, I say!&rdquo; Dan repeated. &ldquo;Or if you can&rsquo;t
take it, there&rsquo;s a nice hot breakfast waiting for you
up at the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chips glared at Dan, and then suddenly relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it, Dan. Can&rsquo;t you take a joke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan let the matter ride. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re sticking with
the gang, it&rsquo;s your turn to help cook breakfast,&rdquo; he
reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Denner! Waffles, creamed chicken and
fresh strawberries coming right up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chips bowed low, a mocking grin overspreading
his freckled face. Only the mischief in his blue eyes
took the edge from his words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>Now Chips never had entirely accustomed himself
to Dan&rsquo;s election as official denner of the Cubs.
Always he had seemed to resent those two gold
stripes on the younger boy&rsquo;s left sleeve. Seldom did
he miss a chance to rub it in if ever Dan ventured
a suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Brad?&rdquo; he asked abruptly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s supposed
to help too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost as if he had heard his name spoken, Brad
thrust his touseled dark head out the cabin doorway.
Thirteen and large for his age, the Den Chief wore
the uniform of a Scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Top o&rsquo; the morning,&rdquo; he chirped. &ldquo;Did I hear
my name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little boss was just saying you&rsquo;re supposed to
help get breakfast,&rdquo; Chips informed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chips, I&rsquo;m not trying to boss anyone,&rdquo; Dan said,
with an effort, holding his temper in check. &ldquo;Every
fellow is supposed to do his share. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, lads,&rdquo; said Brad in his quiet, friendly
voice. &ldquo;This rotten weather has us all on edge. Chips
and I will tackle that breakfast in nothing flat. Just
give me a chance to wash up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The threatened disagreement was brushed away
as of no consequence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>With a warm feeling of gratitude to Brad, Dan
went into the cabin to make up his bed. Good old
Brad! Even tempered and with an efficient way of
getting things done, one always could depend on him
to iron out friction.</p>
<p>Inside the cabin, the other Cubs were scrambling
into their long blue trousers and jerseys. But the
usual clamor of excited voices was lacking. Even
Red, who often kept the Cubs in high spirits with
his wise cracks, seemed subdued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we doin&rsquo; today?&rdquo; he asked plaintively.
&ldquo;Another session of whittling Indian totem
poles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield has something in mind,&rdquo; Dan informed
the Cubs. &ldquo;He may tell us at breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following Dan&rsquo;s example, the Den members
folded blankets which could not be aired outside,
and straightened the cabin. By the time Midge and
Mack brought water from the house, a well-cooked
breakfast was ready.</p>
<p>As they squatted around the fire eating their fill
of bacon and eggs, Mr. Hatfield outlined the morning
plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take long to clean up the dishes,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;Then what say to a boat jaunt across the
river?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not to the village again?&rdquo; protested Chips. &ldquo;We
have more supplies now than we&rsquo;ll need until we
leave here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we might hike to Paul Silverton&rsquo;s
pheasant farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the wealthy sportsman?&rdquo; demanded Mack
Tibbets, all interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He raises unusual imported birds as
a hobby. Of course, it will be pretty wet underfoot,
and if any of you would rather stay here or go
home&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants to stay?&rdquo; Red demanded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
been cooped up long enough. Let&rsquo;s get those dishes
washed pronto!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, look fellows!&rdquo; broke in Mack suddenly. &ldquo;Is
that the real thing or a mirage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the sun had straggled through the
clouds and was casting a few feeble beams over the
drenched camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun! Whoopee!&rdquo; shouted Red, capering
about like an Indian. &ldquo;Aw, who turned it off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if to tantalize the Cubs, the sun after its brief
debut again slipped under a cloud. But a moment
later, out it popped again, this time for several
minutes. The Cubs, greatly cheered, went at their
morning duties with a will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>By ten o&rsquo;clock, knapsacks were packed with sandwiches,
chocolate bars and extra wool socks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield asked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to make
two boat trips across the river. I&rsquo;ll take the first load
with Midge, Fred, Dan and Red. Then I&rsquo;ll return for
the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Dan urged, leading the way to the
dock.</p>
<p>The mahogany dinghy which Mr. Holloway assigned
to the Cubs&rsquo; use was durable and easily
rowed. At a sign from the Cub leader, Dan picked
up the oars, while Midge and Red shoved off.</p>
<p>Swollen by recent rains, the river current was swift
and filled with tiny whirlpools. However, all the
Cubs could swim, and Dan took care to steer clear
of floating logs and debris.</p>
<p>At Eagle Point, Dan and his passengers alighted
and waited on the beach while Mr. Hatfield returned
for the second boatload of Cubs.</p>
<p>When finally all the boys had gathered, Mr. Hatfield
and Midge&rsquo;s father led the group along the
shore over a stretch of rising ground to the edge of
a dense woods.</p>
<p>Then, in single file, the Cubs plunged through a
tangle of damp brush interwoven with grapevines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I failed to reach Mr. Silverton by telephone this
morning,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway remarked regretfully.
&ldquo;Therefore, our visit will come as a surprise to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think he&rsquo;ll object to our seeing the pheasants?&rdquo;
The Cub leader had paused to consider the path
which branched off into several indistinct ones
farther on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should he? We&rsquo;ll ask permission before
wandering around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs trudged on, finding the way heavy
going. Mud clung to their hiking shoes, making
walking increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>An overhanging branch showered Chips with
raindrops as he brushed against it. &ldquo;I sure hope that
pheasant farm isn&rsquo;t much farther,&rdquo; he grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Softie!&rdquo; jeered Midge. &ldquo;Maybe you could sit down
somewhere on a nice comfortable log and we could
bring the pheasants to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, cut it,&rdquo; Chips growled. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t a guy crack a
remark without being accused of turning soft?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield and Dan, who were leading the Cubs,
now halted unexpectedly, bringing the entire line up
short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>Quite without warning, a heavy-set, round-faced
man in checkered flannel shirt and corduroy
breeches, emerged from behind a tree. Clearly he
meant to block the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you boys doing here?&rdquo; he flung at them.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway moved past the Cubs to stand
beside Dan and the Cub master.</p>
<p>Sam answered politely: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on our way to Mr.
Silverton&rsquo;s pheasant farm. This trail leads there, I
believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on Silverton&rsquo;s land now. He told you to
come here, did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no. We&rsquo;re a Den of Cub scouts, and we
thought we&rsquo;d ask permission&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trespassers,&rdquo; the stranger cut in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you we do not mean to be. We very
much would like to visit the farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t. Mr. Silverton doesn&rsquo;t want no-account
boys running wild over the place. They
scare the pheasants and make no end of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs are reliable,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield quietly.
&ldquo;I assure you, you&rsquo;ll have no difficulty on that
score.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, you&rsquo;ll have to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we might see Mr. Silverton&mdash;&rdquo; the Cub leader
began, but again the other interrupted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Saul Dobbs,
and I&rsquo;m in charge here. Now get out before I lose
patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glaring at the Cubs, the workman carelessly allowed
his hand to drop to his belt where he carried
a revolver in a holster. The gesture was not lost upon
either Mr. Hatfield or the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said the Cub leader, still without raising
his voice. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re scaring us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git going and don&rsquo;t come back!&rdquo; Saul Dobbs
ordered in a blustering voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may hear from us again after we have talked
to Mr. Silverton,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;Meanwhile,
good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With dignity, he turned and led the crestfallen
Cubs back along the twisting trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER 2</span>
<br />The Cubs on Trial</h2>
<p>No sooner were the Cubs well beyond the hearing
of Saul Dobbs than they broke into excited argument
over whether or not they should have submitted
to his threats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we just tell him to go jump in the
river?&rdquo; Chips demanded furiously. &ldquo;Just who does
he think he is, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He happens to be Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s foreman,&rdquo; Dan
pointed out quietly. &ldquo;Also, he was armed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was only bluffing,&rdquo; Red volunteered his
opinion. &ldquo;I say, why don&rsquo;t we go back there and tell
him off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield paused on the trail. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you
fellows losing sight of an important fact?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we were trespassers?&rdquo; Dan supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. If Mr. Silverton had given us permission
to have visited the farm, then we&rsquo;d have been within
our rights.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was my fault,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway took the blame.
&ldquo;I should have telephoned Silverton. Instead, I took
it for granted we&rsquo;d see him at the farm and that he&rsquo;d
give his okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considering that he&rsquo;s the foreman, I suppose
Dobbs had a right to order us off the property,&rdquo;
Brad said. &ldquo;But it was the way he did it that got
under my skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The point is, do we have to take it like meek
little lambs?&rdquo; Red demanded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for having it out
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here too,&rdquo; chimed in Mack. &ldquo;Where can we find
Mr. Silverton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; admitted the Cub
leader. &ldquo;We might be able to get some information
in the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go there now,&rdquo; Midge proposed. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we
buy something at one of the stores as an excuse for
asking a few questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposal appealed to the other Cubs and to
Mr. Hatfield and Midge&rsquo;s father as well. Accordingly,
they hiked the half mile to the village of
Camden across the river from Webster City where
nearly all of the boys lived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Having purchased supplies several times before
in the town, the Cubs created little interest as they
tramped into Barker&rsquo;s General Store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll it be this time?&rdquo; the genial storekeeper
inquired after he had waited on his other customers.</p>
<p>Noticing that the fruit looked appetizing, Mr.
Hatfield said he would take two dozen of the fresh
pears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flour? Beef? Bacon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not today. We&rsquo;re well supplied. Matter of fact,
we crossed the river more for the excursion than anything
else. This rain has kept us rather closely confined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, the weather has been against you,&rdquo; the
storekeeper agreed as he weighed the fruit. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
due for a turn though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skillfully, Mr. Hatfield directed the conversation
along the line he wished it to take.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs were saying this morning they&rsquo;d like
to visit Silverton&rsquo;s pheasant farm. By the way, who
is in charge there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fellow by the name of Dobbs&mdash;Saul Dobbs. He
looks after the place for Mr. Silverton. A rather disagreeable
customer, I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it he doesn&rsquo;t like visitors at the farm?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He drives &rsquo;em off,&rdquo; the storekeeper said, handing
Mr. Hatfield his change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On orders from Mr. Silverton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I wouldn&rsquo;t know. But Silverton seems like a
fairly decent sort of chap. Friendly and approachable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t live at the pheasant farm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, in Webster City. Has an office in the Gardner
Building there. On nice weekends, he drives out to
the pheasant farm to look it over, but mostly he lets
Dobbs run the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the Cub leader, pocketing his change.
&ldquo;Well, good morning, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside the general store, the Cubs gathered in
a group to discuss their next move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard how it stacks up,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield.
&ldquo;If we want to visit the farm, we&rsquo;ll have to see Mr.
Silverton. That means a trip into Webster City. Is it
worth the effort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t so crazy to see the place at first,&rdquo; said
Dan. &ldquo;But now I am, if only to prove to Saul Dobbs
that he can&rsquo;t order us around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; agreed Midge promptly.</p>
<p>Red proposed that the Cubs descend upon Mr.
Silverton in a delegation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That hardly seems wise,&rdquo; replied Mr. Hatfield.
&ldquo;I think someone should stay in camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not appoint the ones who are to go?&rdquo; suggested
his son Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me for one!&rdquo; urged Chips instantly. &ldquo;I can give
Mr. Silverton an earful about that workman of
his!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cub leader smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m afraid
you might do, Chips. This mission requires diplomacy
and tact&mdash;you know, smooth talk and control.
I&rsquo;ll delegate Brad and Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;ll we get there?&rdquo; Dan asked, pleased to have
been selected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you in my car,&rdquo; offered Midge&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>The Cubs hiked back to the river and rowed to
their camp. Although the rain had ceased, the river,
they noted, still was slowly rising.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway immediately backed his car from
the garage, ready for the trip to Webster City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck with Mr. Silverton,&rdquo; Sam Hatfield
said as Brad and Dan climbed in beside Mr. Holloway.
&ldquo;Just give him the facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t be afraid to talk up!&rdquo; Chips added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>As the car pulled away, Dan stole a quick glance
at Brad. Always he had admired the dark-haired
older boy who seemed so sure of himself, yet never
was conceited. An outstanding athlete for his age,
Brad would enter Webster City High School in the
fall.</p>
<p>Dan, nearly ten, and fast growing into a bean
pole, was considered old beyond his years. Popular
with nearly everyone, the sandy-haired, blue-eyed
sixth grader entered enthusiastically into all the Den
and Pack meetings.</p>
<p>At the Gardner Building twenty minutes later,
Mr. Holloway parked the car by a curb meter, and
accompanied the boys to Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s fourth floor
suite of offices. A receptionist inquired as to their
wishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to see Mr. Silverton, please,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
requested.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s reply was discouraging. &ldquo;Mr. Silverton
is in an important conference,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;He
may be detained an hour. Isn&rsquo;t there something I
can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway explained that his business was
with Mr. Silverton personally and turned to Brad
and Dan. &ldquo;How about it fellows?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to wait, but I have an important business matter
to look after.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs will be disappointed if we go back
without even seeing Mr. Silverton,&rdquo; said Brad. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
Dan and I wait for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you two can present the matter without
me,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway said, greatly relieved. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
try to get back here in about an hour to pick you up.
If Mr. Silverton is able to see you before I return,
give him the facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; grinned Brad. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the Den Dad had gone, Brad and Dan sat
down on a bench to wait. They studied a wall calendar
and listened to the chatter of a ticker tape
stock machine in an adjoining office. Time dragged
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Holloway will be coming for us soon,&rdquo; Dan
said, ill at ease. &ldquo;I hope Mr. Silverton doesn&rsquo;t forget
we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then, the receptionist came out of the inner
office. &ldquo;Mr. Silverton will see you now,&rdquo; she announced.</p>
<p>Dan and Brad followed the young woman through
a door with frosted glass into a large comfortable
room with thick carpet.</p>
<p>A stout, slightly bald man of nervous manner sat
behind a massive mahogany desk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he inquired, his tone implying that he
expected the pair to state the purpose of their call as
briefly as possible. And then, noticing their uniforms,
he inquired: &ldquo;Boy Scouts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad is,&rdquo; Dan corrected politely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Cub,
Wolf rank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Cub, eh?&rdquo; Mr. Silverton repeated. &ldquo;Is that
something new in Scouting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a program somewhat similar to scouting only
for younger boys and the whole family&mdash;Mothers
and Dads,&rdquo; explained Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have an organization motto? All that sort of
thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir,&rdquo; informed Dan eagerly. &ldquo;Our motto
is: &lsquo;Do your best.&rsquo; Every Bobcat who joins the organization
also promises to be Square and to obey
the Law of the Cub Pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting. Most interesting,&rdquo; said the stock
broker. He doodled figures on a scratch pad. &ldquo;But
what brings you here, may I inquire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs would like to ask permission to visit
your pheasant farm,&rdquo; Brad explained.</p>
<p>Mr. Silverton frowned at the request. &ldquo;My foreman,
Saul Dobbs, informs me that recently some of
the pheasants have been stolen,&rdquo; he said discouragingly.
&ldquo;Furthermore, boys have been sneaking in
and scaring the birds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not the Cubs, sir,&rdquo; said Dan earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, but my pheasants represent a considerable
investment. I can&rsquo;t risk losing choice birds.
I&rsquo;m sorry, but if Dobbs told you to stay out, I&rsquo;m
afraid I&rsquo;ll have to back him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Brad exchanged a startled glance. Instantly
it dawned upon them that the foreman already
had prejudiced his employer against the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dobbs told you about our visit this morning?&rdquo;
Dan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he telephoned to report you were there. He
said you were quite insistent upon seeing the farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, that wasn&rsquo;t exactly true,&rdquo; Brad denied.
&ldquo;We were all walking along the trail, when up pops
Mr. Dobbs with his revolver. He told us to leave, so
we did, without any argument. Mr. Hatfield and
Midge&rsquo;s father were along and they&rsquo;ll back me up in
the statement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say Dobbs threatened you with a revolver?&rdquo;
Mr. Silverton asked, displeased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t exactly threaten us,&rdquo; Dan answered
truthfully. &ldquo;He just put his hand on the holster to let
us know he meant business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t have turned-tail only we&rsquo;re law
abiding and we knew we had no right on the property
without your consent,&rdquo; added Brad.</p>
<p>The straightforward presentation seemed to impress
the stock broker, for after a moment&rsquo;s thought,
he asked: &ldquo;How many boys in your troop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six in the den, not counting myself,&rdquo; Brad said.
&ldquo;All the boys are strictly reliable. It&rsquo;s one of the rules
of the Cubs that we strive to give good will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cubs believe in being honorable,&rdquo; Dan added,
observing that Mr. Silverton was wavering. &ldquo;You can
depend on us not to damage anything on your
farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why are you so set upon visiting the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your preserve has some of the best woodland
in the county,&rdquo; said Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pheasants are incidental? You wouldn&rsquo;t by
chance be wanting to set Saul Dobbs in his place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Brad looked at each other and grinned.
&ldquo;I guess that does enter into it, sir,&rdquo; Brad said truthfully.
&ldquo;He was rather unpleasant and it burned us
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I blame you for your feelings. At
times, Dobbs is inclined to become somewhat officious.
When I gave him permission to carry a
revolver, I didn&rsquo;t expect him to use it to frighten
boys.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t exactly alarmed,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;It was
more annoying than anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys impress me favorably,&rdquo; Mr. Silverton
continued. &ldquo;Dobbs, I think, gave me a wrong slant
on the situation. Now, suppose I should agree to
allow the Cubs to visit the farm. Will you promise
to follow the rules?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will, sir,&rdquo; declared Dan eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll guarantee
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take a look at this map,&rdquo; said the sportsman,
whipping a small one from the top desk
drawer. &ldquo;All the trails on my property are marked.
Now, you may visit the barns, the pheasant runs
and the central area near the foreman&rsquo;s house. But
this breeding ground, where we keep the Germain
peacock pheasant, is restricted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Silverton etched in a small section along the
river and highway. &ldquo;You agree to stay out of this
area?&rdquo; he asked again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already given our promise,&rdquo; said Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Then take this map along,&rdquo; Mr. Silverton
said, thrusting it into Dan&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Good afternoon,
boys.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>Fingering the map, Dan remained facing the
sportsman. &ldquo;Please, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what is it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we have a paper, or some authorization?
Saul Dobbs may not be willing to take our word&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to be sure,&rdquo; Mr. Silverton said hurriedly.
He scribbled a brief note on a memorandum sheet
which bore his printed name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will take care of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You should
have no trouble from now on with Dobbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dan, pocketing the
order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But remember,&rdquo; Mr. Silverton warned as the
boys turned to leave, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re on trial. If any of the
Cubs disobey instructions, your privileges will end.
Now get along with you. I have work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER 3</span>
<br />Stragglers</h2>
<p>Jubilant at having obtained permission to visit
the Silverton Pheasant Farm, Dan and Brad told
Mr. Holloway the good news when he came for
them twenty minutes later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; he praised. &ldquo;You boys must have put up
a good argument. We&rsquo;ll plan a trip to the farm tomorrow
if the weather permits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following morning, cheered by a warm sun
which rapidly dried the damp trails, the Cubs set
off for the Silverton Pheasant farm with Sam Hatfield
and Midge&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, gang,&rdquo; the Cub leader warned as he
paused on the path where the party had met Saul
Dobbs the previous day. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here on trial. Mr.
Silverton will toss us out in nothing flat if we
wander into forbidden areas. Everyone got that
straight?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>To make certain that all the Cubs understood,
Dan passed out the map which Mr. Silverton had
given him the previous day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This section along Crooked Creek near the main
road and the river is taboo,&rdquo; he said, outlining it
with his finger tip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder why Silverton doesn&rsquo;t want us to go
there?&rdquo; speculated Red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he keeps his fancy pheasants in that
area,&rdquo; Dan explained. &ldquo;The point is, Brad and I gave
our promise the Cubs will stay away from the
marked section.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; said Midge. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead on,&rdquo; sang out Mack.</p>
<p>The Cubs moved single file along the narrow
woodland trail, noticing many fine oak, white elm,
ash and birch trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we could get wood here for some dandy
Indian bows and arrows!&rdquo; Fred exclaimed enthusiastically.
&ldquo;Wonder if Mr. Silverton would mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not cut any wood without first asking permission,&rdquo;
said the Cub leader to his son. &ldquo;And no
playful whacks at any of the bushes,&rdquo; he added,
glancing at Chips who was known to have an itchy
hand with a belt axe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>At a brisk pace, Mr. Hatfield led the Cubs on,
crossing a creek at a footbridge. Soon he came to
an open space which permitted a view of the Silverton
barn, the hatchery, the holding pens and a small
dwelling, evidently the cottage where Saul Dobbs
lived.</p>
<p>Beyond the mesh enclosed pens, a field had been
planted in cover strips of sorghum grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; muttered Dan under his breath. &ldquo;Here
comes Old Man Trouble himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saul Dobbs, who had been interrupted as he
clipped the wings of a blue-breasted pheasant, trod
angrily toward the Cubs.</p>
<p>In his gnarled hands he still held the beautiful
bird, whose handsome red neck feathers shaded off
into a long silver white tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big idea?&rdquo; Dobbs demanded harshly.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to stay away from here? D&rsquo;you
want me to call the sheriff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, Mr. Dobbs,&rdquo; said Sam Hatfield.
&ldquo;We have permission to visit the farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton said you could come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The information plainly annoyed the foreman, for
he scowled. &ldquo;How do I know you ain&rsquo;t just saying
that?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Dan produced the memorandum written in Mr.
Silverton&rsquo;s hand. Dobbs read it in stony silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, it&rsquo;s nothing to me one way or the other,&rdquo;
he shrugged. &ldquo;You can look around if you like. But
mind, don&rsquo;t get the birds stirred up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a silver pheasant you have in your
hand?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield inquired pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dobbs agreed, leading the group to another
pen. &ldquo;This here one&rsquo;s a rare breed from the
Himalayas,&rdquo; he explained, pointing to a pheasant
with a short golden-orange tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you keep golden pheasants too?&rdquo; asked Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, they&rsquo;re over in those pens near the barn.
You can tell a golden pheasant by their fluffy yellow
crest, red breast and long yellow tail feathers
in scale pattern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you are quite an authority on pheasants,&rdquo;
the Cub leader remarked, hoping to coax the man
into a good humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I been workin&rsquo; fer Mr. Silverton more&rsquo;n
two years now,&rdquo; Dobbs informed in a less hostile
tone. &ldquo;But pheasant raisin&rsquo; is hard work. You have
to keep close watch of the eggs when they&rsquo;re hatching.
There&rsquo;s pens to be cleaned and fumigated, sick
pheasants to be treated and always you have to be
on the alert to see that none of &rsquo;em get away. I got
too much to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t mean to put you to any trouble,&rdquo; said
Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us keep you from your
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dobbs shot the Cub leader a quick glance, half
suspicious, and replied curtly: &ldquo;If you want to see
the silver pheasants, there&rsquo;s a new hatch of &rsquo;em
over in the south pens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Mr. Silverton keep any birds that are imported
from Burma or the Malay States?&rdquo; Dan asked
eagerly. &ldquo;How about Germain&rsquo;s peacock pheasant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems you&rsquo;re pretty well versed in pheasants,&rdquo;
Dobbs said, eyeing the boy keenly. &ldquo;Who told you
to ask that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no one. Mr. Silverton mentioned it, that
was all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we got a few of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; Dobbs said reluctantly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re having trouble getting the birds
started. You won&rsquo;t find any of &rsquo;em here by the barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently annoyed by the question, the foreman
walked away, leaving the Cubs to their own resources.
However, as they wandered from one enclosure
to another, they noticed that he watched
them closely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Careful not to disturb any of the hens or cocks,
the Cubs spent half an hour around the pens. As
they started to leave, Mr. Hatfield asked the foreman
if he thought Mr. Silverton would object if
they cut a little wood for Indian bow staves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess it&rsquo;ll be all right, providin&rsquo; you don&rsquo;t
leave the trails,&rdquo; Saul Dobbs said grudgingly. &ldquo;Just
be careful what you cut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling that the foreman might not be such a bad
sort after all, the Cubs retraced their way through
the woodland toward the river.</p>
<p>Midway there, Fred suddenly announced that he
was famished. &ldquo;When do we eat?&rdquo; he moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This seems to be as good a time as any,&rdquo; said
Mr. Hatfield, squinting at the sun which had
climbed high overhead.</p>
<p>From their knapsacks, the Cubs broke out sandwiches,
fruit, and candy bars. But when Chips
would have started a fire to warm a can of soup he
had brought along, the Cub leader vetoed the proposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still on Silverton&rsquo;s land,&rdquo; he reminded the
Cubs. &ldquo;No fires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After lunch, the Cubs lay for awhile under the
trees, basking in the steamy warmth of the sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see a lot of good hickory and birch around
here,&rdquo; Red said, stirring to effort. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get busy
on those Indian bow staves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield urged. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t mutilate
any of the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the next hour, the Cubs wandered about,
selecting choice pieces of hickory, white elm and
other woods favored for staves. Midge&rsquo;s father
showed them how to dress the ends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time we&rsquo;re getting back,&rdquo; he announced suddenly,
picking up his knapsack. &ldquo;Come on, gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, where is Chips?&rdquo; Brad demanded, counting
noses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Red?&rdquo; added Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were here only a few minutes ago,&rdquo; Fred
recalled. &ldquo;Come to think, I heard Chips say something
about looking for a yew tree!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That dumb cluck!&rdquo; Dan exploded. &ldquo;If he were
in an evergreen forest, he&rsquo;d start looking for a date
palm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield whistled several times and waited
for an answering signal. None came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red and Chips can&rsquo;t be far away,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want me to go after them?&rdquo; Brad volunteered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all follow their trail,&rdquo; the Cub leader decided.
&ldquo;But keep together, gang. We&rsquo;ve no time to
look for other stragglers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs moved along, eyes intent on the
ground. A short distance from where they had eaten
lunch, Brad came upon a heel mark in a little patch
of black, moist earth.</p>
<p>Pausing, he studied the mark a moment. &ldquo;From
Chips&rsquo; shoe,&rdquo; he identified it. &ldquo;I can tell by that
wing design heel mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little farther on Dan found Red&rsquo;s tracks. A
broken bush indicated the direction in which he
had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least they&rsquo;re together,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway said in
relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those dumb bunnies!&rdquo; Fred said irritably. &ldquo;What
made &rsquo;em wander off that way? Do they think
we&rsquo;ve got nothing to do but trail them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield, deeply troubled, paused at intervals
to give the familiar whistle. No answering call
came through the woodland.</p>
<p>The trail of the two wanderers, led on and on to
the banks of a racing creek.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield paused a moment to study a pile of
logs and debris brought down by the flood. The
litter had accumulated in a narrow gorge formation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Notice how those logs form a dam across the
stream,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water could back up fast in event of a real
flood,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Holloway, following the Cub
leader&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;Fortunately, the rains seem to
have let up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not far from the pheasant runs,&rdquo; Sam Hatfield
said, thinking aloud. &ldquo;If I were in Saul Dobbs&rsquo;
place, I&rsquo;d clear away those logs. Perhaps there&rsquo;s no
danger. But it strikes me considerable damage
might be done if the water should back up any distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t know about the jam,&rdquo; suggested
Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; nodded the Cub leader. &ldquo;However,
some of those logs look as if they&rsquo;ve been here
quite a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan, noticing that the logs formed a perfect
bridge across the stream, started to walk across. The
Cub leader called him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Dan,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let me see that map Mr.
Silverton marked for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Leaping down from the log, Dan fished the paper
from his pocket. While the Cubs peered over his
shoulder, Mr. Hatfield spread it out on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very close to the area Mr. Silverton
marked as restricted,&rdquo; the Cub leader declared.
&ldquo;Directly across the stream is an abandoned logging
road which joins the main highway along the river.
This map shows the old road fenced off&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs waited, but Mr. Hatfield did not complete
what he had started to say. Instead, he stared
at the log jam, lost in deep thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong?&rdquo; Dan asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just wondering about that road across the
creek,&rdquo; the Cub leader said vaguely.</p>
<p>He passed the matter off as of no consequence.
Except for Dan, the Cubs forgot the matter entirely,
because at that moment, Brad gave an excited
shout. In poking about along the sandy shore, he
had made a disconcerting discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, come here!&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>The Cubs quickly joined him along the rim of
the racing stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find Chips and Red right away!&rdquo;
he informed the group. &ldquo;See where their tracks
lead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Den Chief pointed to a series of heel marks,
leading directly away from the stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Clearly, Red and Chips after reaching the site of
the log jam, had left the main trail.</p>
<p>Selecting another, they had continued on, walking
into the forbidden area of Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s property!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER 4</span>
<br />Useful Information</h2>
<p>&ldquo;For the love o&rsquo; lemons!&rdquo; exploded Dan as he saw
for himself that the trail of footprints led into the
restricted area of the Silverton property. &ldquo;What got
into Red and Chips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They knew we gave our promise to Mr. Silverton,&rdquo;
Brad said, deeply troubled. &ldquo;And now, first
crack, they go wandering off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drag &rsquo;em back here before Saul Dobbs
learns about it,&rdquo; advised Fred. &ldquo;It would give him
a good excuse for heaving us all off the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield and Midge&rsquo;s father were even more
troubled than the Cubs over the actions of Chips
and Red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t all enter the restricted area,&rdquo; Mr.
Holloway said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take Brad and Dan and go after
them. The rest wait here with Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the Den Chief and Dan at his heels, Mr.
Holloway rapidly followed the trail which, after
leaving the creek, presently came out at a cleared
area.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>Directly ahead, they saw the two missing Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wahoo! Wahoo!&rdquo; shouted Dan to attract their
attention.</p>
<p>Red and Chips, who had their backs turned,
whirled around to face the approaching trio. Seemingly
unaware that they had committed any offense,
they came trotting toward the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what we found!&rdquo; Chips cried, extending his
hands which were filled with gray pheasant tail
feathers.</p>
<p>Red had a similar collection. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to use
these for an Indian headdress!&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;We
can enter it in the Pack&rsquo;s Indian craft exhibit at the
end of the summer, and maybe win first prize!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You win first prize for being the Den&rsquo;s No. 1
Dodo,&rdquo; Brad said furiously. &ldquo;Cripes! Can&rsquo;t a fellow
trust you a minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad, let me handle this,&rdquo; said Mr. Holloway
quietly.</p>
<p>Turning to the puzzled Chips and Red, he asked
them if they knew what they had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t done anything,&rdquo; Chips insisted. &ldquo;If
all this fuss is about these feathers&mdash;we picked &rsquo;em
up over there on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Red said, made uncomfortable by
the Den Dad&rsquo;s steady gaze. &ldquo;You can bet we didn&rsquo;t
pluck any birds. In fact, we didn&rsquo;t see a single
pheasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t referring to the feathers,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Holloway. &ldquo;Do you realize where you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. On Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s land,&rdquo; Red answered,
still failing to comprehend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the forbidden area, Red. The Cubs
pride themselves on keeping their word and being
honest. You and Chips knew the rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two culprits gazed at each other in consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; Chips exclaimed. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know we
had wandered into the out-of-bounds area. Did we,
Red?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the other returned earnestly.
&ldquo;We just started off looking for wood to make Indian
bows. We didn&rsquo;t find what we wanted, so we
kept walking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we found these feathers,&rdquo; Chips took up
the tale. &ldquo;About that time, we heard Dan call. We
didn&rsquo;t do any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Holloway. &ldquo;But
that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. The point is, through
your carelessness, you&rsquo;ve cast reflection on all the
Cubs. Brad and Dan pledged the Den&rsquo;s honor to
Mr. Silverton.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Chips hung his head. Red, twisting the gray
feathers in his hands, avoided the level gaze of the
Den Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know we were breaking the rules,&rdquo;
Chips mumbled. &ldquo;Dan only gave us one look at the
map. How were we to tell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alibis don&rsquo;t go with me,&rdquo; said Mr. Holloway.
&ldquo;Well, the deed is done. The next question is, what
are we to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we get away from here before Saul Dobbs
catches on, no one will be the wiser,&rdquo; Chips said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is that what you think we should do,
Chips? Sneak out of here and keep quiet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Chips said, hanging his
head. &ldquo;It was just a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you and Red broke the rules. While you may
not have intended to disobey, you weren&rsquo;t careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not go to Mr. Silverton and tell him exactly
what happened?&rdquo; proposed Dan. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s the
right sort, he&rsquo;ll accept our apology and not hold it
against anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does that sound to you?&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
asked the two offenders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; agreed Chips, while Red nodded
morosely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to talk this over with Mr. Hatfield and
the other Cubs,&rdquo; said the Den Dad. &ldquo;But the idea
sounds good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will mean a trip to Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; said
Brad. &ldquo;Probably it&rsquo;s too late to see him today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow will have to do,&rdquo; said Mr. Holloway.
&ldquo;Well, we have no right here. Let&rsquo;s get back where
we belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to the Cubs who waited by the creek,
the Den Dad explained briefly what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chips and Red are willing to apologize to Mr.
Silverton tomorrow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hope that will
square matters. Brad, I think it might be well for
you and Dan to go along, since you&rsquo;ve already met
Mr. Silverton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to, sir,&rdquo; said Brad, while Dan nodded.</p>
<p>Aware that Chips and Red already were worried
by their mistake, the Cubs did not plague them with
questions or accusations. But everyone felt depressed
by the outcome of the little excursion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Mr. Holloway, as the group
left the creek, &ldquo;someone should mention this log
jam to Mr. Silverton tomorrow. It worries me. I
figure he can&rsquo;t know about it, or he&rsquo;d have ordered
it cleared away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to speak of it,&rdquo; offered Dan.</p>
<p>He fell into step with Chips and Red, who for a
long while walked in gloomy silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why Silverton&rsquo;s so fussy about the
Cubs going into that restricted section anyhow,&rdquo;
Chips grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess he&rsquo;s afraid his special breed of Germain
peacock pheasants will be disturbed,&rdquo; Dan said
easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, that&rsquo;s what he told you. But why keep the
Cubs out when he lets others go there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when Red and I were picking up those
feathers we heard voices back of us in the woods&mdash;men&rsquo;s
voices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Red agreed. &ldquo;Someone must have
driven up in a car on the old logging road, because
we thought we could hear an engine running on
the other side of the creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have good ears,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t
hear any car. Or any voices either.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield, who had been walking ahead, had
overheard Red&rsquo;s remark. Dropping back, he fell
into step with the Cubs, listening rather attentively.
Being a native, he knew that section very
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old logging road hasn&rsquo;t been used in years
and has been allowed to grow up in weeds,&rdquo; he
said, thinking aloud. &ldquo;I was told the sportsman
fenced it off where it crosses the main highway.
When the pavement went in three years ago, it
nipped off the terminal of the logging road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Dobbs or some of the workmen drove a
car back in there,&rdquo; Dan remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Dobbs,&rdquo; Red insisted. &ldquo;He has a gruff,
husky voice. There were two men. One spoke in a
high, almost squeaky voice, and the other was just
a mumble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the men or hear what they were
saying?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield asked Red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we didn&rsquo;t pay too much attention. Anyway,
they were off quite a distance. But if Silverton lets
others go into that section, I don&rsquo;t see why he hangs
barbed wire around us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That has nothing to do with it,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield replied.
&ldquo;We gave our promise to stay away from the
restricted area, and we broke it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Chips and I already have said we&rsquo;d explain to
him,&rdquo; Red mumbled, accepting the rebuke.</p>
<p>Without meeting Saul Dobbs, the Cubs returned
to the river&rsquo;s edge. Mr. Holloway took the first boatload
of boys across to the cabin. Mr. Hatfield made
the second trip, finally coming back for Brad and
Dan, the only ones left on the far shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about taking a little jaunt upstream with
me?&rdquo; the Cub leader suggested, shoving off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; Dan asked quickly, surprised by the
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious to see the exit of that old logging
road,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; urged Brad, eager for adventure.
&ldquo;What do you expect to find, Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll find anything, Brad. Let&rsquo;s just
charge this trip off to curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rowing against the strong current proved slow
and hard work. But finally, the Cub leader nosed
the boat into a sheltered cove. Brad and Dan helped
him pull the craft high out of water.</p>
<p>Scrambling up the steep slope, Mr. Hatfield and
the two boys walked along the pavement to the exit
of the old abandoned logging road. A rail fence
blocked it off from the main highway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Before the highway went through, this logging
road ended at the river,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield explained.
&ldquo;Logs were hauled out and floated downstream to
a paper mill at West Haven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was the logging road abandoned?&rdquo; Brad
asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, at least eight years ago. The road was used
some, I think, until Silverton bought the woodland
property for a game preserve. Then he fenced
off the exit to prevent trespassers from driving
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From where Dan stood, he could see only a short
distance up the weed-choked dirt road. Why, he
wondered, was Mr. Hatfield so interested? By this
time he knew the Cub leader never did anything
without a purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk down the road a ways,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
proposed.</p>
<p>As he swung his long legs over the fence, the top
rail tumbled to the ground. Mr. Hatfield waited until
Dan and Brad had stepped over, and then
stooped to replace the barrier. Carefully he examined
the other rails which had been carelessly set
in position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;These logs have been removed quite recently,&rdquo;
he told his companions. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you say someone
has been using this old road? Perhaps entering and
leaving it from the main highway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would fit in with what Chips and Red said
about hearing voices!&rdquo; Brad exclaimed. &ldquo;But according
to the map, this logging road doesn&rsquo;t actually
enter the restricted area of Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it parallels the stream much of the way,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield recalled. &ldquo;One could drive a car in,
park almost anywhere, and if he chose, cross the
creek afoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That log jam makes a regular bridge!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed.
&ldquo;But tell me! Why would anyone except
Silverton or his workman have any reason to use the
road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield did not directly answer the question.
Instead he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not indulging in any fancy
speculation. Just wanted to check up on a few
points, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whistling a line from &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Forever Blowing Bubbles,&rdquo;
the Cub leader set off down the old road.
Rather mystified, Dan and Brad tagged at his
heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>A short distance farther on, Mr. Hatfield paused
to study automobile tire tracks plainly visible in the
grass and sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A car must have been through here two or three
times at least,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;Where does this
road lead, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan offered him the marked map. According to
it, they saw that the old logging road crossed the
pheasant farm and woodland, playing out in the
forest about two miles from the main highway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t attempt to walk the two miles,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield said. &ldquo;However, I do want to check back
as far as the log jam in the creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still puzzled as to why the Cub leader was so
interested in the old road, Brad and Dan kept pace
with him as he rapidly followed the tire tracks.</p>
<p>Seeing no sign of a car, they came presently to
the point of the twisting stream which was choked
with logs and debris.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield immediately noticed that the water
level had dropped slightly since their earlier visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the time being, there&rsquo;s no danger of flood,&rdquo;
he said in relief. &ldquo;But if it should continue to rain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that why we walked back here?&rdquo; Dan asked,
unable to hide his disappointment. &ldquo;Just to check
the water level?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield smiled and shook his head. He had
found another clue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice anything else?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; Dan said, puzzled. Then he corrected
himself. &ldquo;Yes, I do! The automobile tire tracks end
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one can see where the car turned around,&rdquo;
Brad added, pointing to a bush that had been torn
and bent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I came to find out,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you want to know whether or not
the car turned around here?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I figure the information may sometime be
useful,&rdquo; the Cub leader replied vaguely. &ldquo;Just a
hunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His curiosity satisfied, Mr. Hatfield seemed to
lose all interest in the old road.</p>
<p>However, as the trio rapidly retraced their way
to the river and their waiting boat, he dropped a
word of advice to his two companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep this little excursion to ourselves,&rdquo; he
suggested. &ldquo;No use stirring up the Cubs about
something that may not amount to anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can depend on us to keep mum,&rdquo; Brad promised.
&ldquo;But the truth is, you have us guessing too,
Mr. Hatfield. What&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing I can definitely put a finger on yet,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield replied off-hand. &ldquo;Shall we say it&rsquo;s just
a feeling I have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a rather unsatisfactory answer, sir,&rdquo;
grinned Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unsatisfactory perhaps, but it&rsquo;s better than going
off half-cocked with wild speculations.&rdquo; The Cub
leader hesitated a moment and then added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
hoping Mr. Silverton will accept our apology for
invading the restricted area of his property today.
If he shouldn&rsquo;t, well&mdash;a little information may be
useful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER 5</span>
<br />A Flash of Light</h2>
<p>Early the next morning after nearly two days at
Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s shoreland home, the Cubs regretfully
broke up their camp.</p>
<p>As they were packing their belongings into the
cars, both Mr. and Mrs. Holloway assured the boys
they were expected back that weekend for a meeting
of the Pack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be here with bells!&rdquo; declared Dan. &ldquo;Next
week may we visit the pheasant farm again? I intend
to read up on game birds at the library and
make a real study of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether we go there again or not, depends on
Mr. Silverton,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield reminded the Cubs.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plan now, Chips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red and I are to meet Brad and Dan at Silverton&rsquo;s
office at ten o&rsquo;clock this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; approved the leader of the Cubs. &ldquo;Be
sure to let Mr. Holloway or me know how you come
out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Though rather dreading the interview with Mr.
Silverton, Brad and Dan were on hand at the stock
broker&rsquo;s office five minutes before the appointed
hour.</p>
<p>Chips and Red came dragging in ten minutes
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace up, Red,&rdquo; Brad encouraged him, noticing
his downcast face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Silverton will
be so tough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not worryin&rsquo; about the interview,&rdquo; Red
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what makes you look so down at the
mouth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sore because I lost my Wolf badge yesterday.
I guess it pulled off my jersey while we were
in the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; Brad sympathized with him.
&ldquo;Well, maybe you&rsquo;ll find it later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Red shrugged, running a hand nervously
through his short-cropped auburn hair. &ldquo;Well,
let&rsquo;s get this interview over with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad spoke to the receptionist, who had been
watching the Cubs with intent interest. However,
when he asked if they might see Mr. Silverton, she
explained that the stock broker was out of the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He may return tomorrow, but I&rsquo;m not certain,&rdquo;
she said regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to come back later then,&rdquo; Brad replied,
disappointed by their failure to see the sportsman.</p>
<p>Once outside the office, the four boys discussed
their next move. &ldquo;We could explain to Mr. Silverton
by letter,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better though I think,
to see him personally. Let&rsquo;s try to see him later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chips and Red, who were on their way to the
public library, parted with their companions at the
next corner. Brad and Dan went on together, discussing
plans for the week-end Pack ceremony at
Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>So absorbed were they in their conversation that
they bumped squarely into a man who had crossed
the street against a red light. The pedestrian was
Saul Dobbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, watch where you&rsquo;re going!&rdquo; he exclaimed
before they could apologize. And then, recognizing
the pair, he exclaimed angrily: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hoping to
meet you again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without giving either Dan or Brad opportunity
to speak, the man began to berate them in a loud
voice:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton let you visit his pheasant farm,
didn&rsquo;t he? And you promised him you&rsquo;d stick to the
main trails and not disturb the pheasants! But did
you keep your promise? No! The minute you were
out of sight, you sneak into the restricted area!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, Mr. Dobbs&mdash;&rdquo; interposed Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t try giving me any excuses! You deliberately
went into that section by the creek. I got
the goods on you! And you needn&rsquo;t deny it either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is denying anything,&rdquo; Dan said hotly.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll give us a chance to explain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do any explaining to me! You&rsquo;re nothing
but a bunch of unreliable youngsters. If I have
my way, you&rsquo;ll never set foot on Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s land
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being unfair,&rdquo; Brad said quietly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true
two of the Cubs wandered by mistake into the restricted
area. But we went to see Mr. Silverton a few
minutes ago, intending to explain. We couldn&rsquo;t because
he&rsquo;s out of town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A likely story! Well, get this straight! You&rsquo;re to
stay away from the farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though resenting Saul Dobbs&rsquo; manner, Brad nevertheless
said evenly: &ldquo;Mr. Silverton gave us permission
to visit the pheasant farm. It seems to me
he&rsquo;s the one who should decide whether or not our
privileges are withdrawn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to that,&rdquo; Dobbs said, his eyes blazing. &ldquo;I
knew there&rsquo;d be trouble to pay when he let you
Cubs onto the property!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pushing past the two boys, the foreman started
on down the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Mr. Dobbs!&rdquo; Dan called impulsively.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something we want to tell you&mdash;the creek
is jammed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dobbs paid not the slightest attention, if indeed,
he heard. He strode on, turning at the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s heading for Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; Brad
guessed. &ldquo;Probably he will put in a bad word for us
with the secretary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s messed up now,&rdquo; Dan said morosely.
&ldquo;Dobbs can make the situation look ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust him to do it too! Well, I&rsquo;m afraid with
Silverton out of town, all we can do is report to Sam
Hatfield and Mr. Holloway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deeply disturbed by their meeting with Saul
Dobbs, the two boys speculated upon how he had
learned that Chips and Red had entered the restricted
area.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have seen them there or he&rsquo;d have
made a fuss about it yesterday,&rdquo; reasoned Brad.
&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s learned about it since. Maybe he came
upon footprints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the next corner, the two boys entered a drugstore
where they telephoned Mr. Hatfield to report
the failure of their mission. The Cub leader&rsquo;s answer
was reassuring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to
Mr. Silverton myself when he returns to the city.
I&rsquo;m sure everything can be straightened out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation lifted a load from the minds of
the two Cubs. During the next two days, Brad and
Dan went about their usual affairs, not giving the
matter too much thought. True, they twice telephoned
Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s office, only to be told he
had not returned to the city.</p>
<p>However, at the Pack meeting held Saturday
night at Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s cabin, their failure to clear
up the misunderstanding was brought forcibly to
attention.</p>
<p>Without consulting anyone, Chips and Red had
made their collection of pheasant feathers into an
Indian headdress. With more enthusiasm than tact,
they proudly displayed their handiwork to the Den
members.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Neat, huh?&rdquo; Chips asked Brad. &ldquo;Do you think it
might win a prize in the Pack handicraft show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The workmanship is all right,&rdquo; Brad admitted reluctantly.
&ldquo;But those feathers&mdash;well, I wish you
hadn&rsquo;t used &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were lying on the ground, going to waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know,&rdquo; Brad sighed. &ldquo;I guess there wasn&rsquo;t
anything wrong about taking &rsquo;em, except that they
were picked up where we had no business to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think we shouldn&rsquo;t enter the headdress
in the handicraft show?&rdquo; Chips demanded, a trifle
sullenly. &ldquo;After all the work Red and I did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Brad said uncomfortably.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to ask Mr. Hatfield. I&rsquo;m all mixed up. I
just wish Silverton would get back so we could talk
this over and clear up things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Troubled, the older boy looked about for the Cub
leader. Both he and Mr. Holloway were talking to
the parents of the Cubs, answering a multitude of
questions. They were so busy he could not get near
either of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Brad, join in the singing,&rdquo; called Mrs.
Holloway, signaling him from across the room.</p>
<p>To please her, Brad mingled with the group. At
the top of their lungs, the Cubs were warbling:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Old Akela had a Pack. E I E I O,</p>
<p class="t0">And in this Pack he had some Dens. E I E I O.</p>
<p class="t0">With Den 1 here, and Den 2 there</p>
<p class="t0">Here a Den, there a Den,</p>
<p class="t0">Everywhere a happy Den,</p>
<p class="t0">Old Akela had a Pack. E I E I O.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Joining in, Brad began to relax and to feel his
worries slipping away. By the time Mr. Hatfield
gave the signal for the Pack meeting to start, he
again was in a cheerful mood.</p>
<p>Six new Bobcats were to be taken into the Pack,
among them Martin Howell, a nine year old, who
would join Den 2.</p>
<p>Due to the soggy ground, it had not seemed advisable
to build an outdoor campfire.</p>
<p>Instead, Mrs. Holloway, with the help of the Cubs,
had made an imitation fire in the center of the cabin
room.</p>
<p>In the absence of the Pack Cubmaster, Mr. Hatfield,
his assistant, donned a blanket and Indian
headdress in preparation for conducting the ceremony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Dan began to beat the tom tom. The Cubs, wearing
one feather to signify Wolf rank, two for Bear,
three for Lion, and four for Webelos, formed a
square about the fire.</p>
<p>Upon another signal, Brad brought into the room
the boys who were to be accepted into the Pack as
Bobcats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Akela,&rdquo; he said, addressing Mr. Hatfield, &ldquo;I
bring friends who would join the Tribe of the
Webelos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the tribe wish them to join?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them enter!&rdquo; chanted the Pack members in
unison.</p>
<p>Acting as Den Chief, Brad then led the newcomers
into the square, so that they faced Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do our friends know the Law of the Pack and
are they ready to follow it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do, Akela.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let them repeat the Law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Solemnly the boys spoke the words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The Cub FOLLOWS Akela.</p>
<p class="t0">The Cub HELPS the Pack go.</p>
<p class="t0">The Pack HELPS the Cub Grow.</p>
<p class="t0">The Cub GIVES good will.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield then asked the parents of the candidates
to come forward to stand by their sons. Welcoming
them to the Pack, he explained briefly that
Cubbing was a program for the entire family, and
one which centered about the home circle.</p>
<p>The ceremony ended and the meeting broke up
with another song.</p>
<p>Remaining to help clear away the litter after the
others had gone, Brad and Dan walked down to
the river&rsquo;s edge with Mr. Holloway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river seems to be rising again,&rdquo; the Den
Dad said, checking the level. &ldquo;As yet, it is not alarming.
But a hard rain on top of what we&rsquo;ve had might
flood the lowlands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Dobbs has cleared out that dam in
the creek?&rdquo; Dan remarked, turning to stare across
the river toward the Silverton property. &ldquo;We tried
to tell him about it but he acted so ugly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy broke off so suddenly that Mr. Holloway
who was retying the boat, straightened up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see, Dan?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing now, Mr. Holloway. A second ago&mdash;just
as I spoke, I thought I saw a flashing light across
the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;On Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s land, or close to it. Near the
old logging road, I&rsquo;d judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see nothing now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. The flash only lasted a second. There, it
is again! See!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time both Brad and Mr. Holloway saw the
shooting beam of light. Close to the ground, it shone
brightly for a moment and then disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been an automobile headlight or
possibly a spot light,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway said. &ldquo;Odd that
an automobile would be on that old road at this
time of night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we go there to find out if anything
is wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think so,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway replied, smiling
at the boy&rsquo;s eagerness. &ldquo;Someone possibly may
be prowling on Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s premises. More likely
though, Dobbs or another employee is doing night
work. In any case, it is none of our affair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER 6</span>
<br />Indian Feathers</h2>
<p>On the day following the meeting of the Pack,
Dan, Brad, Chips and Red tried once more to see
Mr. Silverton in his office.</p>
<p>The receptionist informed them that the sportsman
had returned to Webster City, but was not
expected in that day. Questioned further by Brad,
she said she thought her employer had driven to
his pheasant farm.</p>
<p>Once outside the building, Chips proposed that
the Cubs go there to see him. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get it over
with!&rdquo; he said impatiently. &ldquo;This suspense of not
knowing what&rsquo;s what is getting me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here too,&rdquo; chimed in Red. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;ve got to apologize,
I&rsquo;m for doing it right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we could hike out there,&rdquo; Brad agreed
reluctantly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long walk though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; urged Dan. &ldquo;The Cubs will be expecting
a report at our next Den meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>Anxious to get the matter settled one way or another,
the four boys set off for the Silverton Pheasant
Farm.</p>
<p>In passing through the village, they waved a
friendly salute to the proprietor of the general store.
If the storekeeper saw them, he gave no sign. At
the moment, Brad thought nothing of the incident,
though later it was to return to mind.</p>
<p>As the Cubs tramped on to the woodland trail,
Dan spoke once more of the strange lights seen the
previous night near the old logging road. Red considered
the incident of slight consequence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saul Dobbs or some of Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s men probably
were working late,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Think nothing
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it seems sort of queer, Red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s queer about it? Dan, you&rsquo;re always trying
to build a mystery out of nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am huh?&rdquo; Dan shot back. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s so, then
why did Mr. Hatfield&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off as Brad shot him a warning glance.
Belatedly, he remembered their promise to say
nothing about the trip made with the Cub leader
along the old logging road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did Mr. Hatfield&mdash;what?&rdquo; demanded
Chips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; Dan said, and deliberately
changed the subject.</p>
<p>Without meeting anyone, the Cubs rapidly made
their way along the narrow trail. Crossing the footbridge,
they came presently within view of the barn.</p>
<p>Saul Dobbs, who had been repairing a wire fence
in one of the pheasant pens, noted the approach of
the Cubs.</p>
<p>With an exclamation of anger, he dropped his
tools and strode toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you about staying away from
here?&rdquo; he demanded, deliberately blocking the
path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were told Mr. Silverton is here,&rdquo; Brad said.
&ldquo;We came to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Silverton has no time to see you. Now
git out and don&rsquo;t come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Resenting the workman&rsquo;s manner, the Cubs stood
their ground. Brad had noticed a large blue automobile
parked not far from the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s car?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git out!&rdquo; Dobbs ordered again, without answering
the question. &ldquo;Mr. Silverton said this morning
not to allow any Cubs ever to set foot on his land
again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton gave such an order?&rdquo; Brad gasped
in disbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure did,&rdquo; Dobbs retorted in great satisfaction.
&ldquo;You broke the rules by going into the restricted
area, so now you can take your medicine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t listen to our explanation!&rdquo; Dan broke
in hotly. &ldquo;At least give us a chance to talk to Mr.
Silverton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you he won&rsquo;t see you and that&rsquo;s final!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angrily, Saul Dobbs grasped Dan by the shoulders
and turned him squarely around in the path.
&ldquo;Now git!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just making that up about Mr. Silverton
not wanting to see us!&rdquo; Chips shouted, ready to do
battle in Dan&rsquo;s defense. &ldquo;You mean you don&rsquo;t want
us to talk to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad placed a restraining hand on the excited
boy&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Chips,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;No sense making
a fuss. We&rsquo;ll see Mr. Silverton later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like fun you will,&rdquo; Saul Dobbs muttered as the
four Cubs started away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you, he&rsquo;s had
his fill of young tereduns.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>Completely discouraged, the boys treked back
to the village. By now they were firmly convinced
that if Dobbs had not poisoned Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s mind
against them, he would do so at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is getting serious,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
to see Silverton somehow, even if it means calling
his office every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warm and out-of-sorts from the long hike, the
four boys dropped in at a village drugstore for ice
cream. The proprietor glanced rather sharply at
them as they entered a booth at the rear of the
store, or so it seemed to Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong with us today?&rdquo; he remarked to
the Cubs. &ldquo;Everyone seems to give us the icy
stare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t noticed it,&rdquo; Dan replied, reaching for the
menu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe I imagined it,&rdquo; the Den Chief
shrugged.</p>
<p>But later, after the four had finished their ice
cream, Chips paused at the counter rack a moment
to flip the pages of a comic magazine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No loitering,&rdquo; the drugstore owner reprimanded
him. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve finished eating, go on outside. I can&rsquo;t
have you cluttering up the place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for crying out loud!&rdquo; Chips remonstrated.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be glad to leave, and we won&rsquo;t come back
either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indignant over the rebuff, the four boys paid their
bill and left the drugstore. However, Brad was
deeply disturbed by what had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t doing anything,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Chips
barely had glanced at the magazine when the proprietor
jumped him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just another old crab!&rdquo; declared Red. &ldquo;This
town&rsquo;s full of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s more to it than that,&rdquo; Brad
said uneasily. &ldquo;When we first went into the drugstore,
the proprietor glanced at our uniforms in a
rather odd&mdash;almost contemptuous way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our uniforms?&rdquo; Dan repeated, puzzled. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
wrong with the Cub uniform?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. But he looked at us almost as if he
were down on Cubs in general. And earlier, that
grocery store owner seemed to give us the cold
shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did at that,&rdquo; recalled Red. &ldquo;The last time we
were here with Mr. Hatfield he was beaming at us
as if we were favorite sons.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even strangers on the street grinned at us and
acted friendly just because we were Cubs,&rdquo;
Dan added. &ldquo;How do you explain the sudden
change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I have a hunch&mdash;&rdquo; Brad began,
only to allow his voice to trail off.</p>
<p>A large blue automobile rounded the corner, taking
the main highway toward Webster City. Both
Brad and Dan recognized the driver as Paul Silverton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is now!&rdquo; Brad exclaimed. &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s
driving back to his office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s trail him there, and have this thing out,&rdquo;
Chips urged. &ldquo;We ought to catch him, if we hike
right back to Webster City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad however, had a better idea. Knowing that
Mr. Silverton might go to his home rather than the
office, he suggested that they wait fifteen minutes,
and then telephone for an appointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ticket!&rdquo; approved Dan.</p>
<p>As the Cubs loitered around the village streets,
they became increasingly aware of unfriendly stares
directed toward them. While not everyone they met
seemed hostile, now and then they were scrutinized
with an intent gaze which made them uncomfortable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have we got measles or something?&rdquo; Red muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has been doing us dirt in this town,&rdquo;
Brad volunteered his opinion. &ldquo;And I have a hunch
who it is too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saul Dobbs?&rdquo; Dan demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not making any accusations just yet. After
we&rsquo;ve talked to Mr. Silverton we may have the
answer. Come on, let&rsquo;s make that telephone
call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeking another drugstore at the edge of the village,
the Cubs dialed the number of Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s
office. Again they were informed he had not returned.</p>
<p>Brad next called the sportsman&rsquo;s home. Finally,
after considerable delay, he heard Mr. Silverton on
the other end of the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton,&rdquo; he began, in his eagerness, talking
too rapidly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to bother you at your
home, but there&rsquo;s an important matter the Cubs feel
should be straightened out. It&rsquo;s about visiting your
pheasant farm&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one of those boys who came to my office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m Brad Wilbur.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, get this!&rdquo; said Mr. Silverton speaking with
biting accent &ldquo;Your privileges are at an end! Now
don&rsquo;t bother me again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton, let me explain,&rdquo; Brad said quickly.
&ldquo;I assure you we didn&rsquo;t deliberately break our
promise&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll explain nothing to me,&rdquo; the sportsman replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen quite enough of your behavior.
The Cubs may consider themselves lucky if I don&rsquo;t
notify their parents and the police!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that remark, Mr. Silverton slammed the
telephone receiver.</p>
<p>Brad, bewildered by the tongue lashing he had
received, called the telephone number again. But
Mr. Silverton would not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say, Brad?&rdquo; Dan demanded as the
Den Chief turned to face the group of Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty! We&rsquo;re to stay away from the farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like we thought,&rdquo; Chips declared. &ldquo;Old
Dobbs got to him first and gave him a line about us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; Brad nodded gloomily. &ldquo;Silverton
said we could consider ourselves lucky that he
hadn&rsquo;t notified our parents or the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police!&rdquo; Dan burst out. &ldquo;How does he figure?
Even if we did make a mistake and go into the
restricted area of the farm, that&rsquo;s no crime! He
couldn&rsquo;t turn us over to Juvenile Court authorities
for that, could he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Brad said, frowning. &ldquo;But
there may be more to this than appears on the surface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning what?&rdquo; demanded Red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s what bothers me. Mr.
Silverton acted as if we had done something serious.
And you&rsquo;ve noticed how the townsfolk here act
toward us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dobbs may have been telling them tales too!&rdquo;
Chips said bitterly. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we have it out
with that bird?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we could see Mr. Silverton face to face,
maybe we could make him understand,&rdquo; Dan ventured.
&ldquo;Any chance he&rsquo;ll talk to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; replied Brad. &ldquo;He slammed the
receiver and now he won&rsquo;t answer the &rsquo;phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the drugstore, the four boys crossed the
bridge and started on the long walk back to Webster
City. Their spirits depressed, they had little to
say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Chips and Red were inclined to feel slightly
abused. On the other hand, Brad and Dan were
worried because all the Cubs had been blamed for
an innocent mistake. Without question, unless the
matter were cleared up, the reputation of Den 2
would severely suffer.</p>
<p>At Denwood Avenue, Red and Chips took leave
of their companions, going to their separate homes.
Brad and Dan continued toward the residential section
of Brandon Heights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton lives somewhere in this part of the
city, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Dan asked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;256 Eagle Road,&rdquo; Brad replied, recalling the
number from having read it in the telephone directory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only two streets from here. Brad, why
don&rsquo;t we go there and try to see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again?&rdquo; Brad kicked a pebble across the sidewalk.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hate to give up,&rdquo; Dan said doggedly. &ldquo;If
we&rsquo;d actually done anything so bad, I&rsquo;d be in favor
of taking our medicine as Dobbs said. But Silverton
at least ought to listen to our side of the
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we can try,&rdquo; Brad consented, though
without enthusiasm. &ldquo;Maybe if we tell him about
that log jam, he&rsquo;ll soften up a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Two blocks farther on, the boys came to Eagle
Road, an exclusive residential street in which the
homes were few and far apart. High above the river
valley, the large dwellings overlooked the business
section of the city.</p>
<p>Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s home near the end of the winding
street, was hemmed in behind a tall privet hedge
which half-hid a view of the handsome 15-room
brick home. At the rear was a rose garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice little shack Mr. Silverton has here,&rdquo; Dan
observed, impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A butler probably will answer the door and say
his master regrets he cannot see us,&rdquo; Brad declared
as he unlatched the front gate.</p>
<p>But in walking up to the porch, Dan spied Mr.
Silverton at the west side of the yard, talking to a
gardener who was weeding a flower bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in luck, Brad!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;There he
is now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wealthy sportsman saw the boys as they
crossed the lawn. Straightening up from the
flower bed, he regarded them with cold disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton, we apologize for intruding,&rdquo; Brad
said. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t have come, only we want to
clear up the misunderstanding.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As far as I am concerned, there is no misunderstanding,&rdquo;
Mr. Silverton answered, starting toward
the house. &ldquo;I understand only too well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saul Dobbs prejudiced you against us,&rdquo; Dan accused,
following after the sportsman, who plainly
intended to walk away from the pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prejudiced me?&rdquo; Mr. Silverton paused and
turned angrily toward Brad and Dan. &ldquo;I saw the
evidence with my own eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidence?&rdquo; Brad caught him up. &ldquo;You mean
footprints in the restricted area?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean dead pheasants. Two of my most valuable
cocks imported from Burma were killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When, sir?&rdquo; gasped Brad, stunned by the disclosure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saul Dobbs found them yesterday not far from
the creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t think the Cubs had anything
to do with it,&rdquo; said Dan in quick protest.</p>
<p>For reply, Mr. Silverton dug into the pocket of
his sports jacket and brought forth a tarnished
badge bearing the design of a wolf with two pointed
ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was found close to the two dead pheasants,&rdquo;
he informed cuttingly. &ldquo;Recognize it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A wolf rank badge,&rdquo; Brad admitted. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s
the one Red lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo; Mr. Silverton went on, &ldquo;Dobbs
has been making a check of the pheasants. A large
number of the common variety seem to be missing.
Some may have flown over the fences, but others
have been taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t accuse the Cubs of that!&rdquo; Brad said,
beginning to lose control of his temper. &ldquo;After all,
we were only there once, and no damage was done.
Two of our Cubs by mistake entered the restricted
area, but they did no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt you believe that to be true,&rdquo; the sportsman
said. &ldquo;But this little badge proves otherwise.
As I told you, it was found not far from the dead
pheasants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw no birds when we went after Chips and
Red,&rdquo; Brad recalled. &ldquo;The pheasants must have died
afterwards of a natural death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly so. But that&rsquo;s neither here nor there.
They died from having been jammed against some
heavy object and bruised. Many of the tail feathers
were missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red and Chips wouldn&rsquo;t have harmed any of the
pheasants,&rdquo; Dan insisted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>Mr. Silverton now seemed determined to bring
the conversation to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you say what your friends did when
they were out of your sight?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Chips and Red wouldn&rsquo;t do a thing like
that,&rdquo; Dan said rather lamely. &ldquo;After all, they&rsquo;re
Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Cubs need feathers for Indian headgears!&rdquo;
Mr. Silverton retorted.</p>
<p>Having delivered this parting shot, he dropped
the Wolf badge at Dan&rsquo;s feet, and without another
word, walked into the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER 7</span>
<br />A Night Excursion</h2>
<p>Brad and Dan were too stunned by Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s
final accusation to make any attempt to follow him
toward the house.</p>
<p>As they stood gazing after the sportsman, the
gardener in an attempt to soften his employer&rsquo;s dismissal,
said kindly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s out of sorts today, lads. It was
a blow to him losing those pheasants. He sets great
store by &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We told him the truth,&rdquo; Brad said, stooping to
pick up the Wolf badge from the grass. &ldquo;The Cubs
never intended to break any rules. As for killing the
pheasants&mdash;well, I can&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gardener leaned comfortably on his hoe. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
like the boss said,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;You may be honest
and square yourselves, but how can you vouch for
your friends? You didn&rsquo;t see what they did while
they were alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And showing those Indian feathers at the village
the way they did,&rdquo; the gardener went on. &ldquo;Why, it
was circumstantial evidence! When Dobbs told
around that the Cubs had trespassed, it was only
natural folks would put two and two together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that was what Mr. Silverton meant when he
spoke of the Indian headdress,&rdquo; Brad muttered.
&ldquo;And it explains why the villagers gave us such icy
looks today! The Cubs are in Dutch everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me sick,&rdquo; Dan said in disgust. &ldquo;Come
on, Brad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sunk in gloom, the two boys left the residential
property, and with no destination in mind, went on
down the street. The gardener&rsquo;s words, together
with Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s accusations, now made everything
plain.</p>
<p>The entire Cub organization had been incriminated
on the basis of two pieces of evidence&mdash;the
finding of the Wolf Cub badge near the dead pheasants,
and the thoughtless display of the Indian
headdress by Chips and Red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew those feathers would get us into trouble,&rdquo;
Brad remarked glumly. &ldquo;And believe me, we&rsquo;re
really in the soup!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad, you don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That Chips or Red killed those birds for the
feathers? No, I don&rsquo;t, Dan. But Silverton&rsquo;s accusation
is serious. We&rsquo;ve got to see Mr. Hatfield about
this right away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys, anxious to unburden themselves,
sought Mr. Hatfield at Scout Headquarters. He listened
attentively to the entire report, and then surprised
them by saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;ve been a little afraid
something like this would develop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you knew about the dead pheasants?&rdquo;
Brad asked in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I noticed a few things at the pheasant
farm which bothered me. By the way, you told Mr.
Silverton about the log jam in the creek?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad and Dan gazed at each other in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re just plain dumb,&rdquo; Dan apologized.
&ldquo;We forgot about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not surprising, considering how upset
you were about Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s accusations,&rdquo; the
Cub leader said, reaching for his telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re calling Mr. Silverton now?&rdquo; asked Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, first I want to talk to Chips and Red again.
I&rsquo;ll ask them to come down here for a few minutes
if they can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>In response to the call from the Cub leader, the
other two boys made a speedy trip downtown again.
Mr. Hatfield, in the presence of the four, then asked
Dan to repeat the accusations made against the
Cubs by the pheasant farm owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, is this your badge?&rdquo; he asked Red, showing
him the one Brad had brought to the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is!&rdquo; Red cried. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton picked it up on his farm near a
couple of dead pheasants,&rdquo; the Cub leader answered.
&ldquo;Red, serious accusations have been made
against all the Cubs. I called you here to ask you a
couple of questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo; invited Red, shifting his weight uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Chips showed that Indian feather headdress
around at the village and elsewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; Red admitted. &ldquo;I guess maybe we
shouldn&rsquo;t have picked up the feathers, but we didn&rsquo;t
see any harm in it at the time. We were kinda proud
of the thing after we made it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the second question. You boys found
the feathers lying on the ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure did, Mr. Hatfield. I hope you don&rsquo;t
think that either Chips or I would have taken them
from live birds?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you the very place we picked them up,&rdquo;
Chips added. &ldquo;You can bet your life we didn&rsquo;t go
around plucking &rsquo;em out of live birds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considering that Mr. Silverton has told the Cubs
to keep off his property, I&rsquo;m afraid I won&rsquo;t be able
to see the place,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said, smiling. &ldquo;But
I do accept your word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we going to prove to other folks that
we didn&rsquo;t steal the feathers?&rdquo; Red demanded. &ldquo;First
off, I&rsquo;ll pitch that Indian headgear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Red. The damage has been done. Hiding the
headdress now would only tend to confirm suspicions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Chips and I can enter it in the Pack
handicraft show? I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d want to after
what&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of time to decide that later on,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield returned. He arose from his desk, a
signal that the interview was at an end. &ldquo;Meanwhile,
I&rsquo;ll see you all at the Indian Pow Wow tomorrow
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the help of Mr. and Mrs. Holloway, the Den
had planned its weekly meeting on an Indian theme.
Midge and Fred had spent the better part of four
days setting up a tepee in the Holloway back yard.
The taut gunny sacking had been painted with
gaudy colors in Indian designs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hope it doesn&rsquo;t rain again and ruin the job,&rdquo;
Midge remarked, as he surveyed his work.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the Cubs had finished their bows
and arrows, and a few now were working on other
items they hoped to enter in the Pack handicraft
show.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the elaborate feather headdress made
by Chips and Red, was by far the best article so
far turned out by Den 2.</p>
<p>But while the two boys followed the Cub leader&rsquo;s
instructions and brought the headgear to the Pow
Wow on the appointed night, they no longer were
proud of their handiwork.</p>
<p>Though the other Cubs were careful to avoid the
subject, everyone knew that the feathers had become
a symbol of the uncleared charge hanging
over their heads.</p>
<p>Entirely unknown to the Den members, Mr. Holloway
and the Cub leader had tried without success
to see Paul Silverton the previous day.</p>
<p>Through his secretary, the sportsman had sent
word that he was &ldquo;in conference&rdquo; and could not be
disturbed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>Determined that the unfortunate affair should not
mar the Indian Pow Wow, Mr. Hatfield and Mr.
Holloway made no mention of their failure to iron
out differences.</p>
<p>By the time the parents of the Cubs began to arrive
at the Holloways, a roaring Council fire was
burning in the beach area near where the Indian
tepee had been set up.</p>
<p>At a smaller fire, some distance away, Mrs. Holloway
stirred a huge kettle of fragrant stew which
would be served after the ceremony.</p>
<p>The tomtoms presently burst into life, and Sam
Hatfield, garbed in an Indian blanket, took the
center of the circle.</p>
<p>Relating the story of Akela, chief of the Webelos
Tribe, he told of the strength and wisdom of the
great leader&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;Arrow of Light,&rdquo; and of his
mother, &ldquo;Kind Eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the Wolf of the forest, Akela learned the
language of the earth,&rdquo; he told the listening Cubs.
&ldquo;And from the Bears, he acquired the secret names
of the trees and the calls of the birds. Courage he
learned from the Lion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield then explained that the Webelos
tribal name had an inner meaning which in the
organization signified progress from Wolf rank,
through Bear and Lion classification to the ultimate
goal of full fledged Scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-be-lo-s,&rdquo; he repeated, spelling it slowly.
&ldquo;Loyal we&rsquo;ll be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what does &lsquo;Arrow of Light&rsquo; signify?&rdquo; inquired
Mack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Progress toward good citizenship. Cubs, like the
Indians of old, must be self-controlled, loyal, game
and quiet&mdash;willing to talk little and listen much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If our Cubs live up to the rules&mdash;if they are
square and game&mdash;our Den will be respected and
make its influence felt in the community,&rdquo; added
Mr. Suell, one of the Den fathers.</p>
<p>The first part of the program completed, he then
told the Cubs of an exciting trip he recently had
taken to Mesa Verde National Park, site of the cliff
dwellers.</p>
<p>The Cubs asked a great many questions and examined
pottery and blankets which Mr. Suell had
brought back from the Indian country. After that,
Fred, Mack and Dan put on an Indian ceremonial
dance, characterized by more energy than grace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Presently the Pow Wow concluded with all the
Den members forming a &ldquo;living circle.&rdquo; In close
formation, facing inward, each Cub grasped the
thumb of the boy on his left, raising right hand high
in the two-finger Cub sign.</p>
<p>Up and down like a pump handle went their
hands as the boys shouted: &ldquo;Akela, we&rsquo;ll do our
Best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the word &ldquo;Best,&rdquo; all the Cubs snapped smartly
into salutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for grub!&rdquo; shouted Red, breaking away.
&ldquo;That stuff in the kettle sure smells good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead me to it,&rdquo; yelled Chips.</p>
<p>Dan and Brad circulated among the parents,
waiting until everyone had been served before they
took their helpings of stew.</p>
<p>In the chill night air, the hot food exactly hit the
spot. Time after time, the Cubs went back for more
until the big kettle was nearly empty.</p>
<p>Brad and Dan sat slightly apart from the others,
their faces splashed with firelight. They were
silently staring out across the dark river, when Mr.
Hatfield, coming up behind them, touched their
shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything to the other Cubs,&rdquo; he
warned in a low tone. &ldquo;Just follow me to the
beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Brad asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you at the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wondering why the Cub leader was acting so
mysteriously, the pair quickly put aside their plates,
and joined him at the dock. To their further surprise,
Mr. Hatfield began to untie the dinghy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo; Brad asked again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I propose to find out,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield replied. &ldquo;A few minutes ago, I heard a car
turn down into the old logging road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near Silverton&rsquo;s place?&rdquo; Dan interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, at least I think the car was on the logging
road. And I&rsquo;m quite certain I saw a flashing light
on Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I was right the other night about that flashing
light!&rdquo; Dan cried. &ldquo;Are you going to investigate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Figured I might row up the river and look
around. Want to ride along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure do,&rdquo; Brad declared, stepping into the
boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already told your parents not to expect you
home for an hour,&rdquo; the Cub leader said as he shoved
off. &ldquo;I have my car here and will drop you off at
your homes after we get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Few lights showed along the dark shore as Mr.
Hatfield silently plied the oars. The boat spurted
along, propelled by powerful strokes. Nearby, a
sizeable fish leaped from the swift moving water,
and fell back with a splash.</p>
<p>Hunched into their jackets, Dan and Brad speculated
upon what the Cub leader might expect to
see or find once they reached the old logging
road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we have no business going there,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield said presently, swerving the boat toward
shore, &ldquo;but I figure it this way. The Cubs are under
suspicion, and it&rsquo;s up to us to clear our name if
we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think someone may be sneaking into Silverton&rsquo;s
place at night and taking pheasants?&rdquo; Dan
guessed. &ldquo;Then we get the blame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an angle I intend to investigate,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
admitted. &ldquo;In looking around though, we&rsquo;ll
have to respect Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s order not to trespass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, it may not be easy to learn anything,&rdquo;
Brad said, a little disappointed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>Without replying, the Cub leader eased the boat
in until it grated on the beach. Brad and Dan leaped
out into the wet sand, and with Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s aid,
pulled the craft well beyond reach of the greedy
waves.</p>
<p>The three hid the oars in a clump of bushes and
set off at a fast walk toward the exit of the old logging
road.</p>
<p>As they approached the log fence barrier, Dan
suddenly halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, isn&rsquo;t that a car coming out of the road now?&rdquo;
he demanded.</p>
<p>In the obscure light shed by a half moon, they
saw a shadowy figure replacing the removable rails
of the fence opening. Another man sat behind the
wheel of a station wagon which had passed through
to the main highway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield urged the Cubs, hastening
his step. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see who they are before they
drive away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, as he spoke, the man at the fence suddenly
abandoned his effort to replace the rail.
Allowing it to drop to the ground, he moved
swiftly to the waiting station wagon and scrambled
in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>With a roar of the engine, the station wagon
pulled away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! See if you can read the license number!&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield exclaimed, turning the beam of his
flashlight on the rear plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t make it out,&rdquo; Brad muttered. &ldquo;The plate
is covered with mud. Maybe on purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the first two letters were WA,&rdquo; Dan
said. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be sure though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield went over to the rail fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That car may have had a right to be on Silverton&rsquo;s
property,&rdquo; he commented as he stooped to lift
the loose rail into place. &ldquo;All the same, I didn&rsquo;t like
the way those fellows rushed off when they saw
us coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were up to something, all right,&rdquo; declared
Dan. &ldquo;They acted as if they were afraid we&rsquo;d see
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An automobile whizzed past on the main highway,
its bright headbeam momentarily illuminating
the logging road exit.</p>
<p>Dan bent to tie a dangling shoelace. In stooping,
he noticed a small piece of cardboard lying by the
railing almost at his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Absently he picked it up, thinking that it looked
a little like a railroad ticket check. Then his interest
quickened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, turn on your flashlight a minute, Mr. Hatfield!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve found something!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER 8</span>
<br />Rain</h2>
<p>The bright beam of Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s flashlight revealed
the torn half of a shipping tag from a freight
shipment. Of recent date, it bore the destination of
Malborne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Malborne is a city of about 500,000 population
to the east of here,&rdquo; the Cub leader remarked.</p>
<p>Disappointed, Dan dropped the tag to the ground.
&ldquo;I guess this isn&rsquo;t anything after all,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, wait, Dan!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield retrieved the torn
ticket. &ldquo;This may have been dropped by one of the
men in the station wagon. As a clue, it doesn&rsquo;t mean
much now, but later on, it might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carefully, the Cub leader placed the soiled scrap
of cardboard in his jacket pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you figure all this?&rdquo; Brad asked earnestly.
&ldquo;Do you think those men, whoever they are,
may be stealing pheasants and maybe shipping them
out of here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Could be, Brad. At any rate. I&rsquo;m convinced Mr.
Silverton doesn&rsquo;t know this road is being used at
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could keep watch and find out who
comes here,&rdquo; Dan proposed. &ldquo;Maybe the Cubs could
divide up into pairs and take turns staying
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All night? Afraid your parents wouldn&rsquo;t approve,
Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever comes, seems to arrive fairly early in
the evening,&rdquo; Brad pointed out. &ldquo;These summer
nights it doesn&rsquo;t get dark until about nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re siding with Dan?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said,
chuckling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs would get a big kick out of keeping
watch of this place, sir. Even if they only kept a daytime
patrol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might learn something at that,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
conceded. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll talk to the fathers of the Cubs
to see what they say. Meanwhile, let&rsquo;s forget about
that station wagon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the three rowed downstream to the Holloway
cabin a little later, they noticed that the moon again
was veiled by dark clouds. Even as they reached the
dock, a few splatters of rain stirred the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here it comes again,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield sighed. &ldquo;This
has been one of the wettest seasons in my recollection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time the three reached the dock, everyone
except Mr. and Mrs. Holloway and their son had
left the cabin. By then, rain was coming down
steadily.</p>
<p>Brad and Dan, already wet through, made a dash
for Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to Mr. Holloway and the other fathers
tomorrow,&rdquo; the Cub leader promised, starting the
motor. &ldquo;If this rain keeps on, we won&rsquo;t be able to
do anything for a day or two in any event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rains continued. Although not heavy enough
to occasion alarm as to the level of the river, the
Cubs were kept indoors.</p>
<p>For want of an occupation, Dan spent much time
swimming at the &ldquo;Y&rdquo;. He worked on the official
buckskin record of Den meetings, bringing it up to
date. And he completed a stamp album which he intended
to show in the hobby and handicraft exhibit
planned by the Pack.</p>
<p>After that, confinement began to fret him. On the
third day when he came downstairs for breakfast, his
first act was to glare at the weather report in the
morning paper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For crying out loud!&rdquo; he complained bitterly.
&ldquo;More rain, the man says. Can you feature that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s a long range forecast,&rdquo; his mother
said encouragingly. &ldquo;The sun seems to be straggling
through the clouds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does look brighter,&rdquo; Dan admitted, willing to
hope. &ldquo;Maybe it will clear up in a couple of weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time he had finished breakfast, the sun
actually was shining. Greatly encouraged, Dan went
outside to inspect the garden. He was intently studying
a worm wriggling across the sidewalk, when a
car stopped at the curb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, there, Dan!&rdquo; called Mr. Hatfield cheerily.
&ldquo;Wet enough for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan grinned with pleasure and went over to the
car to talk to the Cub leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m about ready to blow my top!&rdquo; he told Mr.
Hatfield. &ldquo;Three days now with nothing to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been tough, Dan. The other Cubs feel the
same way. Itching for something to do. But rain or
shine, we&rsquo;ll have our regular Den meeting Friday
night at the cabin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it weren&rsquo;t so wet, we might start that
patrol at the old logging road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean we can do it?&rdquo; Dan cried, his face
cracking into a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I talked to most of the fathers. They&rsquo;re in favor
of doing anything we can to prove that the Cubs had
nothing to do with killing those pheasants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When can we start, Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for the Cubs to decide. Not much use in
keeping watch too early in the day. Midge&rsquo;s father
thought we might go on duty about four in the afternoon
and stay until after dark. One of the fathers
will keep the boys company on the last shift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we start this afternoon?&rdquo; Dan demanded
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woods are rather wet, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could put on slickers and boots. Anyway,
the sun&rsquo;s out again. The ground will dry some before
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield consented. &ldquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t
rain any more, find another Cub and go out there at
four o&rsquo;clock. I&rsquo;ll send someone to relieve you by
six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thanks, Mr. Hatfield!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may not thank me by the time your stint is
finished,&rdquo; the Cub leader laughed as he shifted gears.
&ldquo;It will be a tedious grind, and probably a fruitless
one. Oh, yes, one thing! Keep out of sight, and be
careful about leaving a lot of tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll defeat our purpose if anyone learns we&rsquo;re
watching the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. Well, good luck, Dan. I don&rsquo;t look for anything
to develop today, but starting the patrol will
keep the Cubs out of mischief at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elated at the prospect of action, Dan immediately
busied himself on the telephone. First he called
Brad, but the Den Chief was helping his father with
work about the house and could not make the trip
to the woodland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my stint tomorrow,&rdquo; Brad promised.</p>
<p>Red, next on Dan&rsquo;s list, begged off because he had
the start of a cold. In the end it was Chips who
agreed to go with him.</p>
<p>From the start, however, the vigil bored Chips. He
disliked staying out of sight in the bushes near the
old logging road exit, and he fretted at inactivity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay here and keep watch,&rdquo; he directed Dan.
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll wander around and look for different
types of leaves to press and mount in a scrapbook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing,&rdquo; Dan promptly vetoed the idea.
&ldquo;We stick together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m tired of hunching under these hot, bug-eaten
bushes! No one&rsquo;s come here in broad daylight
and you know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know when that station wagon may return,
Chips. We&rsquo;ve got to develop patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your preachy talk! It won&rsquo;t do any harm
to move around a little. My legs are getting
cramped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield said we&rsquo;d defeat our purpose if we
walk around and leave a lot of footprints. Especially
when the ground is soft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start sprouting roots if I sit here any longer,&rdquo;
Chips complained. He slapped angrily at a mosquito
which buzzed around his head. &ldquo;How long are we
supposed to stay here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sticking until relieved. If you&rsquo;re soft and want
to pull out, go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan waited, but Chips made no move to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Chips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know I&rsquo;ll suffer it out,&rdquo; the boy muttered.
&ldquo;Quit rubbing it in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that Chips made no further complaint,
though at intervals he twisted and squirmed and
emitted loud groans which startled a gray squirrel
in the tree overhead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Throughout the long watch, not a person was seen
nor a sound heard on the old logging road. In the
bush shelter near the barrier, the two cubs passed
the time by counting cars which traveled on the main
highway. Even Dan became a bit careless, making
less effort to keep out of sight.</p>
<p>Then suddenly he was startled to hear approaching
footsteps. Quickly he drew back into the leaves,
pulling Chips with him.</p>
<p>As the two Cubs waited, Saul Dobbs came into
view. He walked to the barrier gate and stood there
for a few minutes, one foot on the lower rail, gazing
up and down the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s looking for someone,&rdquo; Dan whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silverton wouldn&rsquo;t use this old logging road,
Chips. Not with that fine car of his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dobbs stood a moment longer at the gate, and
then taking an old envelope and a pencil stub from
his pocket, scribbled a message.</p>
<p>The Cubs saw him spear the paper on the barrier
fence. However, the breeze fluttered it to the
ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Picking up the message, Dobbs reread it and appeared
to hesitate. To the bitter disappointment of
Chips and Dan, he then tore it to pieces and thrust
the scraps into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder why he did that?&rdquo; Chips whispered.</p>
<p>Dan motioned for his companion to be quiet.
Dobbs had turned and now was coming directly
toward their hiding place.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the man halted, staring at something
on the road. Dan and Chips felt their blood
turn to ice cubes. For there on the moist ground were
several footprints made from Chips&rsquo; shoe.</p>
<p>Dobbs stared long and hard at the imprints and
gazed up and down the road. Apparently satisfied
that no one had been in the vicinity recently, he
finally turned and went off in the direction from
which he had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! That was a close call!&rdquo; Chips muttered
when it again was safe to speak aloud. &ldquo;I see what
you mean now about leaving tracks, Dan. We doggone
near gave ourselves away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the future we&rsquo;ll have to be even more careful.
And we&rsquo;d better warn the other Cubs too. Wonder
why Dobbs tore up that note after he wrote it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He acted as if he were expecting someone and
wanted to leave &rsquo;em a message. Just our bad luck he
changed his mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, our day hasn&rsquo;t been wasted after all,&rdquo;
Dan declared.</p>
<p>Time wore on uneventfully. Finally at six o&rsquo;clock,
the two Cubs spied Fred and Mack coming up the
pavement at a leisurely pace.</p>
<p>Slipping from their hiding place, they greeted
them with intense relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything doing here?&rdquo; Fred inquired.</p>
<p>Dan related how they had seen Saul Dobbs at the
gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing so strange in that,&rdquo; Mack commented.
&ldquo;After all, this road runs through Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only queer part was that he wrote a note to
someone and then tore it up,&rdquo; Dan pointed out. &ldquo;It
was almost as if he thought it over and decided it
was risky business&mdash;that someone might find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He nearly found us,&rdquo; Chips cut in. &ldquo;Better be
careful in leaving footprints on this road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will you stay here?&rdquo; Dan asked the
two newcomers as he and Chips prepared to
leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield said we could take over until eight
o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Mack answered. &ldquo;Then he and Midge&rsquo;s
father will watch for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky guys,&rdquo; grinned Chips. &ldquo;Especially if the
mosquitoes are in biting trim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the next two days, the Cubs took turns watching
the exit of the old logging road. Though they remained
faithful to their assignment, the novelty began
to wear off and the task became increasingly
tedious.</p>
<p>True, the Cubs developed a certain technique for
making time pass more quickly. Working always in
pairs, they brought books, magazines, and an occasional
card game with them to the hide-out in the
brush.</p>
<p>Even so, a two-hour vigil seemed endless. Mosquitoes
were a constant torment, and nothing ever
seemed to happen.</p>
<p>After his initial appearance, Saul Dobbs did not
return again to the exit of the logging road. Nor did
they glimpse the mysterious station wagon which
had so intrigued their interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was an accident it came down this road
the other night,&rdquo; Brad said late one afternoon as he
and Dan were taking their trick together. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a cinch it&rsquo;s not coming back. We&rsquo;ve wasted our
time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think so too,&rdquo; Dan replied in a
discouraged voice. &ldquo;Gosh, this place is like a steam
bath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst it&rsquo;s been since we took over,&rdquo; Brad
agreed.</p>
<p>The afternoon had turned unusually hot and sultry.
Not a leaf stirred in the trees overhead. Wiping
the perspiration from his face, Dan got up to stretch
his half-paralyzed legs.</p>
<p>Through the gap in the trees overhead, he could
see only a tiny patch of sky which seemed to be
darkening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like another rain cooking up,&rdquo; he observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cripes! Not again!&rdquo; Brad moaned, peering up
at the overcast sky. &ldquo;If this keeps on, I&rsquo;m going to
build myself an Ark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better start the carpenter work then, Brad. It
sure looks like rain. And she&rsquo;s coming up fast this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moving out of their shelter the better to view the
sky, the two boys were somewhat alarmed to note
that a large black cloud was rolling in fast from the
west.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means rain and a hard one,&rdquo; Brad said.
&ldquo;Think we ought to strike out for home?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hate to leave our post until Mr. Hatfield
gives the order,&rdquo; Dan said after a moment&rsquo;s consideration.
&ldquo;Anyway, we&rsquo;ve waited too long. We never
could get home ahead of the rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably right,&rdquo; Brad agreed, anxiously
studying the fast-moving clouds. &ldquo;The storm is due
to break almost any minute. Lucky we brought along
our slickers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buttoning themselves into their long raincoats,
the two boys prepared as best they could for the
expected downpour.</p>
<p>Soon a faint breath of air rustled the tree leaves.
In the quiet of the forest, the sound was ominous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she comes!&rdquo; muttered Brad.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he spoken when a rumble of thunder
echoed through the woods. A few drops of rain filtered
down between the thick canopy of leaves.</p>
<p>Then, wind and rain came on with a rush which
sent the two boys deeper into the woods for shelter.</p>
<p>Though they flattened themselves against the lee
side of two large oaks, they could find no protection.
The rain began to fall in a torrent. It lashed their
faces, streamed down their slickers and soaked their
shoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Limbs loosened by the wind came crashing down.
Now and then a vivid flash of lightning etched an
electrical pattern across the dark sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very safe here,&rdquo; Brad said, ill at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to seek shelter deeper in the woods, or
get out entirely,&rdquo; agreed Dan, buttoning his slicker
tighter about him.</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, a brilliant flash of lightning
etched across the sky, so bright that momentarily it
blinded the two boys. And the following roar of
thunder made them jump.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, came a ripping, tearing sound
which told them that the heart of a mighty tree had
been struck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! It&rsquo;s that big oak!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed, squinting
through the rain.</p>
<p>The big tree came crashing down, smashing away
smaller saplings and bushes in its path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might just as well have been this one,&rdquo; Dan
murmured, gazing uneasily up into the mass of swaying,
wind-twisted boughs above his head. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in
a bad spot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How right you are,&rdquo; murmured Brad.</p>
<p>A bright flash of lightning made the woods as
bright as day. In that moment the boys saw the wind
whirling like a vicious animal in the treetops. And
two hundred yards away another tree fell, making a
resounding crash as it toppled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>The sight spurred the Cubs to sudden decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, I know Mr. Hatfield wouldn&rsquo;t want us to
risk staying here in this storm,&rdquo; Brad said, seizing
his companion&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Come on, boy, we&rsquo;re getting
out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER 9</span>
<br />A Rising Creek</h2>
<p>Alarmed by the intensity of the storm, Dan and
Brad made a dash through the whipping trees, seeking
an open area. Rain now was descending with
furious power, lashing directly into their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, I can&rsquo;t see a thing!&rdquo; Dan gasped. &ldquo;Which
way is the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad turned on the beam of his flashlight, but it
failed to penetrate the blinding wall of rain.</p>
<p>Just then the lightning flared again, revealing an
opening through the bushes. Beyond Brad glimpsed
the old logging road, a river of rainwater despite its
under-base of gravel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way, Dan!&rdquo; he shouted encouragingly. &ldquo;Follow
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sloshing through water and mud, they reached
the barrier fence and climbed over. The blinding
sheet of rain all but blotted out a view of the pavement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re safer here anyhow,&rdquo; Brad said as they
emerged from the woodland. &ldquo;Brother! Is this a
storm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rain showed no signs of slackening. However,
now that the boys were in a cleared area, the wind
seemed less menacing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dropping a little,&rdquo; Brad observed, studying
the treetops along the pavement. &ldquo;The crest of the
storm probably has passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the rain is still wet,&rdquo; Dan shivered. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s
steady. No sign of a let-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Along the ditches, muddy water was rushing at a
furious rate, draining toward the nearby river.</p>
<p>The two boys scarcely knew which direction to
go. They could recall no houses close by where they
might seek shelter. The nearest habitation was Mr.
Holloway&rsquo;s camp across the river, but they had no
boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a filling station up the road about a quarter
of a mile!&rdquo; Brad recalled, shouting to make himself
heard above the roar of the wind. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan nodded and followed his companion. Rain
drove directly into their faces, closing off their view
and making it difficult to walk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I sure wish a car would come along,&rdquo; Brad muttered.</p>
<p>Now that they would have welcomed a ride, the
busy highway suddenly had become a deserted
thoroughfare.</p>
<p>Struggling on, the Cubs presently came to a stone
bridge arching over a creek. Upon reaching it, the
boys noticed that already its murky waters were
within two inches of flooding the pavement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; Brad exclaimed, pausing to glance briefly
at the raging torrent. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming up fast&mdash;and I
mean fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this the same creek that flows through Mr.
Silverton&rsquo;s property, Brad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the log jam hasn&rsquo;t been cleared out before this,
the water&rsquo;s likely to start backing up in the pheasant
runs just as Mr. Hatfield predicted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of it,&rdquo; Brad agreed. &ldquo;Saul Dobbs ought
to have looked after things. But if he failed to, well,
this storm will sure make a mess of things at the
farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys stood a moment longer watching the
torrent race beneath the stone archway. So fast was
the creek rising that they could see the lapping
waters nibbling away at the concrete. It would soon
cover the pavement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty minutes and the water will be running
over the road,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s clearing out at the
pheasant farm, all well and good. But if it starts
backing up there, Dobbs is in for plenty of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan made no reply. The two boys pushed on
through the slanting rain without meeting or being
passed by a car. Finally, soaked and muddy, they
reached the filling station.</p>
<p>An attendant, seeing them coming, flung open the
office door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look like a couple of drowned rats,&rdquo; he
laughed. &ldquo;Here, shed those coats before you flood
the place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad and Dan stripped off their slickers and wiped
their dripping faces with a coarse towel which the
attendant brought from one of the rest rooms. Then
they sat down by the electric heater to outwait the
rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a regular cloudburst,&rdquo; the filling station
attendant remarked, watching the rain pelt against
the window. &ldquo;Worst storm we&rsquo;ve had this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we use your telephone?&rdquo; Dan requested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Go ahead. It&rsquo;s your nickel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Dan dialed Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s number, intending to
tell the Cub leader that he and Brad had taken
refuge at the filling station.</p>
<p>There was no answer. Actually, the Cub leader
at the moment was driving to the logging road.
Alarmed by the intensity of the storm, he had lost no
time in setting forth to pick up the Cubs.</p>
<p>Unable to reach Mr. Hatfield, Dan next telephoned
his own home where his mother answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you are safe, Dan,&rdquo; she said in relief.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call Brad&rsquo;s mother and set her mind at ease.
Don&rsquo;t try to come home until the rain lets up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a half hour, the storm continued without signs
of slackening. Then as suddenly as it had started,
the rain ended. Clouds gradually cleared away and
the sun straggled out. Steam began to rise from the
drying pavement.</p>
<p>Brad and Dan wandered outside, debating
whether to return to their post or walk to Webster
City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield wouldn&rsquo;t expect us to go back there
after such a terrific storm,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;On the other
hand, I don&rsquo;t like to walk off a job just because the
going gets tough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>A big truck loaded with furniture rumbled into
the station. The driver sprang out and after ordering
the attendant to fill up the gasoline tank, began to
inspect the heavy-tread tires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was sure some storm,&rdquo; he remarked to the
filling station man. &ldquo;Up in the hills the rain was
heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cinch the river will rise again,&rdquo; replied the
attendant, removing the hose from the mouth of the
gasoline tank. &ldquo;Creeks running high?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of their banks most places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any serious floods between here and Alton
Heights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, but it&rsquo;s only a matter of time. The water&rsquo;s
coming up fast. I was lucky to get through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The snatch of conversation had been overheard
by Brad and Dan and added to their alarm.</p>
<p>Although they knew the river would not rise to a
dangerous level for many hours, the flood risk at
Silverton&rsquo;s pheasant farm was immediate.</p>
<p>If the rain had been heavy in the hill area as reported
by the trucker, then an enormous amount of
water soon would pour down into Crooked Creek.
Even under normal circumstance, the narrow stream
scarcely could be expected to carry the excess away
without flooding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Brad stood nervously drumming his fingers against
the wall of the filling station, thinking matters over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure wish I knew if Saul Dobbs ever cleared
away that log jam,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What do you think,
Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your guess is as good as mine. But knowing him,
I&rsquo;d say he hasn&rsquo;t touched those logs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m afraid of Dan. Dobbs has been
mighty unpleasant to the Cubs. Even so, I&rsquo;d hate to
see any of Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s pheasants drown through
his carelessness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, I&rsquo;m going to telephone Dobbs,&rdquo; Brad said,
reaching a sudden decision. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have the
matter off our minds at least. Got a nickel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My last one,&rdquo; Dan said, fishing a coin from his
pocket.</p>
<p>Brad found the number of the Silverton Pheasant
Farm in the directory which hung from a cord on the
wall. But no one answered his call. He allowed the
telephone to ring a long while before finally hanging
up the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; he said in disappointment. &ldquo;Dobbs
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be there. Maybe he&rsquo;s outside looking
after the pheasants.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>The filling station attendant who had come into
the office for change, overheard Brad&rsquo;s remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to get Saul Dobbs?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find him at the pheasant farm. Just
before the storm broke I saw him driving toward
Webster City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he hasn&rsquo;t returned since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that means there&rsquo;s no one in charge now at
the pheasant farms,&rdquo; Brad said anxiously. &ldquo;With the
creek rising so fast, it&rsquo;s likely to back up into the
pens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saul Dobbs is a careless, shiftless sort,&rdquo; the filling
station man replied with a shrug. &ldquo;I never could see
why Mr. Silverton kept him in charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning from the telephone, Brad&rsquo;s troubled eyes
sought those of Dan in silent question.</p>
<p>Both boys knew that something must be done
quickly if the pheasants were to be saved. Yet they
hesitated to disobey by again venturing onto private
property to investigate the choked stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s telephone Mr. Silverton,&rdquo; Dan urged. &ldquo;Being
in the city, he may not realize how heavy the rain
was out here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Brad lost no time in making the call. But when he
gave his name at Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s office, he coldly
was informed that the sportsman was &ldquo;busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must talk to him right away,&rdquo; Brad argued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; repeated the voice. &ldquo;Mr. Silverton has
given orders that your calls are not to be transmitted
to him. So sorry.&rdquo; The receiver clicked in his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you like that?&rdquo; Brad howled. &ldquo;We try
to save his old pheasants and he won&rsquo;t even talk
to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get word to him somehow,&rdquo; Dan
insisted. &ldquo;Brad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we hitch a ride with that truck driver
into the city? If we can get to Silverton&rsquo;s office in
time, we ought to be able to make someone understand
what&rsquo;s happening out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad did not take a moment to debate. Already
the trucker was starting to pull away from the filling
station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he urged, bolting out the door.</p>
<p>The boys signaled the truck driver who halted
just before he reached the main highway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you driving to Webster City?&rdquo; Dan shouted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give us a lift?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure will,&rdquo; the trucker agreed heartily, opening
the cab door. &ldquo;Hop in, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the truck rattled along the slippery road, Dan
and Brad told the driver of their urgent reason for
reaching the Gardiner Building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making no mistake in thinking that creek
will flood,&rdquo; the trucker declared, putting on more
speed. &ldquo;Even if the stream isn&rsquo;t clogged, she&rsquo;s sure
to go over her banks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To help the boys, the driver dropped them off
directly in front of the Gardiner Building. Their
shoes caked with mud, their wet hair still plastered
down, the pair made a sorry appearance as they
entered Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s outer office.</p>
<p>Seeing Brad and Dan, the receptionist regarded
them with cold disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you over the telephone that Mr. Silverton
will not see you,&rdquo; she said before Brad could speak.
&ldquo;Those are his orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must see him!&rdquo; Brad insisted. &ldquo;Rains have
flooded the creek and some of the pheasants may
drown if they aren&rsquo;t taken care of right away!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>The receptionist looked somewhat startled. Having
no idea what the boys were talking about, she
shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I positively cannot disturb Mr. Silverton now,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;If you want to wait on the chance he&rsquo;ll see
you when he comes out, you may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will that be?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton usually leaves his office at four-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fifteen minutes yet,&rdquo; Brad said, glancing
anxiously at the wall clock. &ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t delay.
Please&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already explained that I cannot disturb Mr.
Silverton. Now if you don&rsquo;t mind, I have work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The receptionist busied herself typing a letter.
However, the boys saw her gaze with disapproval at
the enlarging pool of water which dripped from
their slickers onto the floor.</p>
<p>At intervals, Dan and Brad would get up from the
bench and go to the window. Fifteen minutes already
had elapsed. And still Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s office
door remained closed.</p>
<p>Then at twenty minutes to five, when the Cubs
had nearly given up hope, the sportsman unexpectedly
walked out of his inner office. He wore his
hat and coat and would have passed through without
speaking to anyone, had not the receptionist stopped
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton, these boys have been waiting a
long while to see you,&rdquo; she informed the pheasant
farm owner. &ldquo;They are quite insistent that it is important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sportsman gazed at Brad and Dan, and appeared
to look straight through them.</p>
<p>Deliberately turning his back, he then strode
toward the outer door.</p>
<p>The Cubs had no intention of allowing him so
easily to elude them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Mr. Silverton, we must see you for a
minute!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed, starting after him.</p>
<p>The sportsman acted as if he had not heard the
appeal. Walking rapidly, he continued toward the
elevator.</p>
<p>Rebuffed, but nevertheless determined that Mr.
Silverton should listen, the two boys pursued him
down the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton, listen to us just for a moment&mdash;&rdquo;
Brad began, but the stock broker cut him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pests!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Unless you cease annoying
me, I&rsquo;ll turn you over to a policeman. I&rsquo;ve had
quite enough of Cub Scouts!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>By this time the elevator had stopped at the third
floor. Glaring angrily at Brad and Dan, Mr. Silverton
entered the cage.</p>
<p>But not alone.</p>
<p>Stung by the sportman&rsquo;s bitter words, the two
boys crowded in with him. The cage door closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton,&rdquo; Dan said, gazing directly at the
sportsman. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry to force ourselves upon you.
But I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to listen to us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I will, eh?&rdquo; Mr. Silverton demanded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
see about that!&rdquo; He rapped his cane sharply on the
floor of the cage door. &ldquo;Attendant, let me out of
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, he spoke too late, for already the elevator
was moving slowly downward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER 10</span>
<br />The Cubs Lend A Hand</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton,&rdquo; Dan began, speaking rapidly
because he knew he had only a moment in which to
present his case. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about your pheasants&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attendant, stop the elevator at the second floor,&rdquo;
the sportsman directed the operator of the cage. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
walk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevator man, observing the despairing look
of the two boys, deliberately let the lift slide past
the second floor level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, sir,&rdquo; he said, fumbling with the levers.
&ldquo;Too late, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton, you&rsquo;ve got to listen!&rdquo; Dan went on
desperately. &ldquo;The creek&rsquo;s rising fast out at your farm!
With that dam across the stream, it may flood the
pheasant runs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last he had gained Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dam?&rdquo; the sportsman demanded. &ldquo;What are you
talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Logs have jammed across the creek, sir. Mr. Hatfield,
our Cub leader, said if it rained hard, water
would be almost certain to back up and flood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trucker told us the area up in the hills had a
regular cloud burst,&rdquo; Brad added. &ldquo;When that water
gets down here, adding to what we&rsquo;ve already had,
the creek will come up fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevator had halted at the first floor and the
cage door slid open. But Mr. Silverton had lost his
desire to elude the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saul Dobbs told me nothing about the stream
being clogged,&rdquo; he said, looking worried. &ldquo;How long
has this condition existed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We noticed the logs on our visit to your farm several
days ago,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;We wanted to tell you
then, but you wouldn&rsquo;t talk to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I haven&rsquo;t forgotten a certain little matter
still between us.&rdquo; Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s pouchy face again
became frozen and unfriendly. He turned to leave
the elevator, saying in curt dismissal: &ldquo;Well, thanks
for telling me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Brad. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think&mdash;that
is&mdash;shouldn&rsquo;t you try to do something to save the
pheasants?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Saul Dobbs can be depended upon to look after
my interests. Should any emergency develop at the
farm, he&rsquo;ll get in touch with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just the point, Mr. Silverton,&rdquo; Dan interposed.
&ldquo;Dobbs isn&rsquo;t on the farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Silverton now gave the boys his complete
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not there?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan related the information given to him by the
operator of the filling station. At last he saw that the
sportsman was beginning to be disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Dobbs isn&rsquo;t at the farm, that changes the picture!&rdquo;
Mr. Silverton exclaimed. &ldquo;With the creek rising,
the pheasants easily could be endangered! Why
did Dobbs go away without notifying me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Dan nor Brad made any attempt to answer.
Nor did Mr. Silverton expect them to do so,
for he seemed to be thinking aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive out there right away and see what&rsquo;s
happening! Will you boys come with me? I&rsquo;ll need
you to point out where the gorge is choked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, we&rsquo;ll be glad to go!&rdquo; Brad agreed quickly.</p>
<p>Mr. Silverton led the way to a nearby parking lot
where he kept his automobile. At a fast clip they
drove over the slippery pavement to the pheasant
farm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>En route, they encountered two areas where fast-running
ditch water had overflowed the road. However,
they were not too deep to prevent the car from
getting through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea the rain was so heavy,&rdquo; Mr. Silverton
commented. &ldquo;Of all times for Dobbs to leave the
farm unattended this takes the prize!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The drive to the farm offered the two boys an
excellent opportunity to explain to Mr. Silverton
again that the Cub Scouts never had intended to
break any of the rules laid down by him.</p>
<p>Delicacy however, prevented them from bringing
up the subject. Mr. Silverton seemed so worried and
absorbed in his thoughts that they decided any discussion
of the matter or apology must wait until after
the present emergency.</p>
<p>As the big blue car descended the private gravel
road and presently emerged at the cleared area of
the pheasant farm, Brad and Dan saw that they had
not exaggerated the situation. It was even worse
than they had anticipated.</p>
<p>Already an ugly line of murky water had spread
through the woodlands to the lower level areas. The
hatching yard in the grove was covered with an inch
of water. Overflow from the creek slowly nibbled at
the walks leading to the house and to the barn on
somewhat higher ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dobbs!&rdquo; Mr. Silverton shouted. &ldquo;Are you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Receiving no answer, the sportsman parked his
car some distance behind the barn and ran to the
house. All the doors were locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right!&rdquo; Mr. Silverton said to the Cubs.
&ldquo;Dobbs has gone off, apparently for the day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the water&rsquo;s creeping up fast,&rdquo; Brad said, gazing
anxiously at the pheasant pens which already
were beginning to flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice mess!&rdquo; the sportsman muttered. &ldquo;Half of
my pheasants will be lost if I don&rsquo;t get them out of
the fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we help?&rdquo; Dan offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll need you and anyone else I can get. This
will be a big job. We&rsquo;ve got to work fast to keep
ahead of the rising water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smashing a glass pane at the rear door of the
foreman&rsquo;s dwelling, Mr. Silverton went inside to
telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to round up men,&rdquo; he explained a few
minutes later to Brad and Dan. &ldquo;But at best it will
take an hour for anyone to get here. And it&rsquo;s an awkward
time&mdash;close to the dinner hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the Cubs would help if I could get word to
them,&rdquo; Dan said eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can use anyone, and I&rsquo;ll pay well for the work.
The vital thing is to get help fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Mr. Hatfield should be showing up at the
old logging road exit to relieve us of our stint!&rdquo; Brad
exclaimed. &ldquo;Dan, if you could reach him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go after him,&rdquo; Dan agreed instantly. &ldquo;If he
isn&rsquo;t there, I&rsquo;ll call him from the filling station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you cut through the woods, be careful not to
be trapped by the flood waters,&rdquo; Mr. Silverton
warned as Dan started away. &ldquo;Keep well to the north
of the creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Brad to help the sportsman, Dan set off
through the woods at a fast dog trot.</p>
<p>Shadows were deepening among the trees, but he
kept his sense of direction. Circling around the
flooded area, he struck the logging road at a point
well beyond the clogged point of the stream.</p>
<p>To the right he could hear the rush and roar of the
torrent which raced toward the river. Unless the log
jam gave away or the crest of the flood was soon
past, he knew that in a short while the entire side
road would be under water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>His shoes and clothing caked with mud, Dan
presently came out at the rail fence barrier. A familiar
looking car, which had pulled up on the other
side of the paved highway, was just starting away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s automobile!&rdquo; Dan thought.
&ldquo;If only I can catch him before he drives away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scrambling over the rail barrier, he shouted the
Cub leader&rsquo;s name. In the act of shifting gears, Mr.
Hatfield heard the boy and turned his head.</p>
<p>Seeing Dan, he quickly switched off the engine
and ran to the fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Brad?&rdquo; he asked anxiously. &ldquo;When the
storm broke so suddenly, I came out here as fast as I
could. Had a flat tire on the way, which held me up.
Is Brad all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s with Mr. Silverton,&rdquo; Dan replied, and poured
out his story of Dobbs&rsquo; disappearance and the threatened
flood disaster at the pheasant farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one there but Brad and Mr. Silverton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, and the water is coming up fast.
Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s trying to get men from Webster City,
but having no luck. Brad stayed with him to do what
he could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silverton <i>is</i> in a spot,&rdquo; the Cub leader declared.
&ldquo;When I saw that log jam in the creek, I was afraid
something like this would happen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield, do you think the Cubs could help?&rdquo;
Dan asked breathlessly. &ldquo;If only we could round
them up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can and will, Dan. Jump into the car! We&rsquo;ll
make a whirlwind trip into Webster City and see
how many boys we can find!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driving as fast as the slippery pavement permitted,
the two soon reached the city. Notified as to
the emergency at the pheasant farm, Red, Chips,
Mack and Fred immediately offered their services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wear your slickers and either high boots or
galoshes,&rdquo; the Cub leader advised the boys. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
plenty moist out at Silverton&rsquo;s place and the creek
still is rising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield, in stopping at his own home to pick
up his son and a pair of hip boots for himself, paused
long enough to telephone Mr. Holloway and Midge.
The information received from across the river was
disconcerting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t come with us,&rdquo; he reported to the
Cubs. &ldquo;The river is rising fast, and Mr. Holloway is
afraid the cabin may be flooded within a few hours.
He and Midge are sticking close to look after things
there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh all fish hooks!&rdquo; Red groaned as he piled
into Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s car with the other Cubs. &ldquo;If the
flood reaches the cabin, some of our Den equipment
may be ruined. Especially our handicraft work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left the pheasant feather war bonnet there
somewhere,&rdquo; Chips added with concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Holloway and Midge will look after your
things,&rdquo; the Cub leader reassured the boys. &ldquo;The
water hasn&rsquo;t reached the cabin yet. As soon as we&rsquo;ve
done what we can to help Mr. Silverton, we&rsquo;ll drive
over to Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the way Silverton talked about the Cubs, he
doesn&rsquo;t deserve too much help&mdash;&rdquo; Chips began, but
a glance from Mr. Hatfield silenced him.</p>
<p>Taking the longer route which entered the Silverton
property from the higher level road, the Cub
leader was able to drive his car within a hundred
yards of the pheasant farm barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! The water&rsquo;s even higher than it was when
I left!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed in dismay.</p>
<p>Already, many of the pheasant pens were partially
submerged by the creeping, chocolate-colored water.</p>
<p>Brad and Mr. Silverton, wet to their waists, had
used grain to coax some of the more valuable pheasants
into traps or carrying crates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>Sorely beset, they had been unable to free the
penned pheasants or to carry any of the crates to
higher ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure are glad to see you!&rdquo; Brad exclaimed as
the Cubs tumbled from Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s car. &ldquo;Boy!
Can we use a little help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall we take the pheasants?&rdquo; the Cub
leader asked, quickly surveying the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the barn is the best place,&rdquo; Mr. Silverton
decided. &ldquo;Turn them loose there. The water
shouldn&rsquo;t come that high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get busy, boys,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield instructed the
Cubs.</p>
<p>Handling the crates carefully, the boys carried
them one by one to the barn. There, after making
certain the doors and windows all were closed, they
set the startled birds free on the ground floor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, along the pheasant runs, Mr. Silverton
aided by Brad and Mr. Hatfield, had been collecting
the traps. As rapidly as the pheasants were caught,
the Cubs carried them to the barn where they milled
with the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done all we can here,&rdquo; Mr. Silverton decided
as deepening shadows made it difficult to
locate straggling pheasants. &ldquo;Some will take refuge
in the trees and bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The water&rsquo;s still coming higher,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
observed as he prepared to move his car. &ldquo;If the
gorge were cleared out, the level should drop fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what can be done,&rdquo; Mr. Silverton proposed.</p>
<p>Both men moved their cars to higher ground lest
flood waters continue to rise. Then, followed by the
Cubs, they circled around to the old logging road,
approaching the dam from the upper and drier
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Dobbs would leave a mess like that in the
stream, I can&rsquo;t figure!&rdquo; Mr. Silverton exclaimed in
disgust as he caught sight of the jam. &ldquo;He must have
known about it, but he never spoke of it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield casually pointed out that the logs
formed a natural bridge, adding: &ldquo;Almost as if they
had been laid deliberately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do at that!&rdquo; the sportsman agreed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
have a closer look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Mr. Hatfield and the Cubs waited on dry
land, he waded out to examine the accumulation of
debris. When he returned to the group a few minutes
later, his expression was grim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Mr. Hatfield,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
convinced those logs were placed deliberately. Apparently,
more has been going on here than I suspected!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any chance to dislodge them?&rdquo; the Cub leader
questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without a crew of men. But a stick of dynamite
would do the trick. I think Saul Dobbs has some
locked up in the tool house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the Cubs waited, the two men started back
to the house to obtain the dynamite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I can&rsquo;t figure, is why anyone would go to
the trouble of making a log bridge at this particular
point,&rdquo; Dan said, frowning as he watched the water
spill over the makeshift dam. &ldquo;Farther up stream,
there&rsquo;s a perfectly good foot bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This section is near the restricted part of the
woods,&rdquo; Brad commented. &ldquo;Mr. Silverton keeps his
best Germain pheasants there. And say! I wonder if
they&rsquo;re safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water&rsquo;s backing up fast in that direction,&rdquo;
Red observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we ought to investigate,&rdquo; Dan proposed.
&ldquo;Think it&rsquo;s safe to cross the dam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water isn&rsquo;t more than ankle deep,&rdquo; Brad decided.
&ldquo;We can get across if we&rsquo;re careful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Joining hands, the Cubs cautiously waded through
the shallow sheet of water which coursed over the
top of the dam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mack, you and Fred stay here to wait for Mr.
Hatfield and Silverton,&rdquo; Brad instructed. &ldquo;Otherwise,
they&rsquo;ll wonder what became of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though disappointed to be left behind, the two
Cubs made no protest. Brad, Dan, Chips and Red,
then went on alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chips, I wish you&rsquo;d show us again where you
and Red picked up those pheasant feathers,&rdquo; Brad
said suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, providing the place isn&rsquo;t under water,&rdquo; the
other agreed. &ldquo;I guess it won&rsquo;t be, because we&rsquo;re
moving into higher ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four Cubs continued for a short distance, and
then Red and Chips fell into an argument as to the
exact place where they had found the feathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was right here,&rdquo; Red insisted, indicating a
small clearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; denied Chips. &ldquo;It was farther on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan paid no heed to the two Cubs, for he had
made an interesting discovery of his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows, come here!&rdquo; he called excitedly. &ldquo;See
what I&rsquo;ve found!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER 11</span>
<br />Dan&rsquo;s Discovery</h2>
<p>Dan stood at the entrance to a path which had been
masked with a pile of dead brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what have you found?&rdquo; Chips demanded as
he and the other Cubs hurried over. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything
to make a howl about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then look at this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan lifted away the pile of brush. Beyond they
saw a freshly made path which wound through a
dense tunnel of overhanging bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just another trail,&rdquo; said Red in disappointment.
&ldquo;The way you yipped, I thought you&rsquo;d made
an important discovery, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so cock-sure this isn&rsquo;t important,&rdquo; Brad
caught him up. Stooping, he peered up the path,
trying to see in which direction it led.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s important about it?&rdquo; Red demanded. &ldquo;Mr.
Silverton&rsquo;s farm has dozens of trails. We saw &rsquo;em
marked on the map, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the point,&rdquo; drawled Dan. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
this trail ever was on the map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it with you?&rdquo; Brad asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The map?&rdquo; Dan dug in one pocket after another.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have&mdash;yes, here it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emerging from the path so as to obtain a better
light, Brad studied the map. In the deepening
shadows, he barely could make out the markings,
and was unable to locate the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Dan,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;This trail
doesn&rsquo;t appear on Silverton&rsquo;s map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything so remarkable about that?&rdquo; Chips demanded.
&ldquo;Maybe the path was made after he drew
up the map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smart deduction,&rdquo; Brad grinned, returning the
map to Dan. &ldquo;But made by whom? That&rsquo;s the fifty
dollar question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe by those fellows in the station wagon
who&rsquo;ve been using the old logging road,&rdquo; Dan offered
his theory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be,&rdquo; Brad admitted. &ldquo;It all fits in. The
natural bridge&mdash;this path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fits in where?&rdquo; Chips demanded in an
aggrieved tone. &ldquo;You guys think you&rsquo;re funny, talking
in code?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not hiding anything,&rdquo; Brad denied. &ldquo;All
the clues are plain to see if you know how to read
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;re saying doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor me,&rdquo; added Red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s like this, kiddies,&rdquo; grinned Brad. &ldquo;You
and Chips found a lot of pheasant feathers here,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not far from the same spot, Mr. Silverton or
Dobbs come upon two dead birds. Check?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; admitted Red, &ldquo;but I still don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know someone has been using the old logging
road. Well, maybe that log jam was put in the
creek for a purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make a bridge across,&rdquo; supplied Dan. &ldquo;Whoever
did it, wanted the dam to look natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think someone planned to flood the pheasant
runs?&rdquo; Chips asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Brad explained patiently, &ldquo;that part probably
was an accident. The bridge was just a convenient
means of getting into this section of the
woodland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you believe someone has been stealing
pheasants from Mr. Silverton?&rdquo; Red said slowly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the bright boy is catching on!&rdquo; declared
Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your theory may sound good to you, but I&rsquo;d say
it&rsquo;s full of holes like a sieve,&rdquo; Red retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Saul Dobbs must have known about that
log jam. And living on the place, how could he help
but know if a strange car used the old road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m wondering myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly knowing what to do, Brad stood staring
thoughtfully up the dark, mysterious looking path.
It had not been used many times, he knew, for the
grass was worn thin in only a few places. Elsewhere,
it merely was heavily trampled.</p>
<p>Though tempted to see where the trail led, he
hesitated to take time to explore it. Soon it would be
quite dark, and none of the Cubs had brought a
flashlight.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with night coming on, the air was
becoming chilly. In their damp clothing, the boys
already were thoroughly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Brad?&rdquo; Dan asked eagerly.
&ldquo;Shall we find out where this path leads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question stirred the Den Chief to decision.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We might follow it a little ways,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
someone ought to stay here, just in case Mack or
Fred should come looking for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to stay&mdash;not alone,&rdquo; announced
Chips, as the Den Chief&rsquo;s gaze singled him out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you and Red wait here together,&rdquo; Brad
directed. &ldquo;Dan and I won&rsquo;t be gone long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you hear us whistle twice, come a-running,&rdquo;
Chips advised as the pair started off together. &ldquo;Mr.
Hatfield may get back any minute and want us all in
a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Dan leading the way, the two boys walked
swiftly along the path. The ground sloped upward
away from the general direction of the creek. All
along the tunnel of bushes, Brad noticed broken
branches, indicating to his observing eye that an
object wider than the path itself had been carried
along the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly can see ahead,&rdquo; Dan complained. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
sure getting dark fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since we&rsquo;ve come this far, let&rsquo;s keep on a little
longer,&rdquo; Brad urged. &ldquo;I think I see a clearing
ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few yards more and the pair came to a small
lean-to constructed of second-hand lumber marred
by numerous knot holes. The building, low to the
ground, had been set back almost out of sight amid
the bushes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Dan asked, for they had come to
the end of the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks a little like a tool shed, only I don&rsquo;t think
it could be,&rdquo; Brad said, equally puzzled. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have
a look inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ill-fitting door had a bolt and padlock. However,
the latter hung loosely and had not been
snapped shut.</p>
<p>Brad opened the door and peered into the dark
interior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing here,&rdquo; he reported, and then corrected
himself. &ldquo;Yes, there is too! Looks like a crate of something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diving into the lean-to, he pulled the crate out
where they both could see it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pheasants!&rdquo; exclaimed Dan. &ldquo;Two of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beauties if you ask me, Dan. What kind are
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one looks like a Germain peacock type,&rdquo; Dan
said, identifying it from a picture he had seen in a
library book. &ldquo;Gray plumage eyed with metallic
spots. His tail probably would spread out if he
weren&rsquo;t cooped up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the other one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be an Impevan pheasant,&rdquo; Dan said
doubtfully. &ldquo;That green crested head and red neck
feathers would make me think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all of me, it could be a grouse,&rdquo; Brad
chuckled. &ldquo;Wonder why these birds are cooped up
here without any food or water, and not too much
air?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad, you don&rsquo;t suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan did not finish what he had intended to say,
for at that moment running footsteps pounded on
the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s coming&mdash;but fast!&rdquo; Brad muttered,
shoving the crate back into the lean-to. &ldquo;Hide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew Dan back deep into the bushes behind
the building.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the two taken cover, than a bedraggled
figure bounded into view. In relief, the pair
saw that it was Red who had followed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad! Dan!&rdquo; he hissed in a stage whisper.</p>
<p>Mystified by his secrecy, the pair stepped from
their hiding place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! Duck back out of sight!&rdquo; Red muttered in
warning. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s coming?&rdquo; Brad demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A couple of men. I don&rsquo;t know who they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you see them?&rdquo; Dan asked, for as yet
he heard no sound on the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Red said, his words fairly tumbling over
each other. &ldquo;Fred and Mack saw &rsquo;em coming up the
log road in a station wagon. When they came to the
water, they parked and crossed the bridge afoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They?&rdquo; Brad caught him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t know who they were. Fred and
Mack were on this side of the log bridge. When they
saw those birds coming, they hid in the woods to
watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were they seen by the men, Red?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Mack sneaked on ahead to warn
you. He&rsquo;s with Chips now at the entrance to this
path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the men are coming this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t wait to see, but I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers!&rdquo; Brad muttered. &ldquo;If they see that the
bushes were pulled away from the path, they&rsquo;ll be
suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mack and Chips took care of that. They put the
brush back in place. The only thing that might give
us away unless we&rsquo;re seen, are footprints. And it&rsquo;s
too dark to make them out now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Dan warned, grasping Brad&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I
can hear someone coming up the path now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duck!&rdquo; Red advised, taking shelter in the thicket.</p>
<p>Brad started to follow his example, then thought
of something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That crate of pheasants!&rdquo; he whispered to Dan.
&ldquo;Help me with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan could not guess what the Den Chief intended
to do, but there was no time to ask questions. As
Brad carefully swung open the door, he lifted out
the crate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, so those birds don&rsquo;t start squawking,&rdquo; Brad
cautioned. &ldquo;Shift it into the bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Red&rsquo;s help, Dan lifted the crate back out
of sight. Meanwhile, Brad had closed the door of
the lean-to.</p>
<p>The approaching footfalls and murmur of voices
now were very close.</p>
<p>Flattening himself on the ground, Brad crawled
into the bushes, disappearing into their shelter just
as two men entered the clearing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER 12</span>
<br />A Crate of Pheasants</h2>
<p>In the indistinct light, the Cubs scarcely could distinguish
the features of the two strangers.</p>
<p>Both were dressed in rough clothing and high
rubber boots. The taller of the pair wore a large-brimmed
felt hat which completely hid his face.</p>
<p>The other, whom the Cubs never before had seen,
was stockily built, muscular, and walked with a
heavy tread.</p>
<p>Neither of the men spoke as they moved directly
to the lean-to. The taller of the pair opened the
creaking door and peered inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing here!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Not a single
crate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; the other demanded, looking for
himself. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ve been double crossed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it, Jake,&rdquo; the other muttered, angrily
slamming shut the door. &ldquo;He told us he&rsquo;d leave the
birds here, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. He telephoned me at my home early this
morning and said everything was set. Figure he
pulled a fast one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless the storm coming up kept him from leaving
the birds here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, but I got my doubts,&rdquo; the other rejoined.
&ldquo;For a long time now, he&rsquo;s been trying to crawl out
of this business. The yellow livered dog is afraid of
being caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to put the screws on him harder then.
Lately, he ain&rsquo;t been delivering enough to hardly
make it worth while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still talking, the two men started to move away
from the lean-to. At that instant Red, who was nearly
paralyzed from having remained so long in the same
position, shifted slightly.</p>
<p>A stick beneath his body crackled, in the stillness
of the forest, snapping like a tiny firecracker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that, Jake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t hear anything,&rdquo; the other man replied,
but he stopped to listen.</p>
<p>In the bushes behind the lean-to, the three Cubs
sucked in their breath and waited tensely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I heard someone back there in the
brush,&rdquo; the heavy-set man declared. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take
a look.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>He started toward the bushes where the three
Cubs had gone into hiding with the crate of
pheasants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, come on,&rdquo; the other said impatiently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
getting late and the creek&rsquo;s still rising. If we don&rsquo;t
get back, we might be trapped on this side of the
stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; his companion agreed. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d
have sworn I heard something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the relief of the three Cubs, the pair with no
further conversation, walked rapidly away.</p>
<p>Red, Dan and Brad waited until they were certain
there was no risk of the two men returning. Then
they came out of their hiding place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of it, Brad?&rdquo; Dan asked, keeping
his voice low. &ldquo;Ever see those two before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! They came here expecting to find that
crate of pheasants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saul Dobbs must have left them in the lean-to,&rdquo;
Dan speculated. &ldquo;Brad, he&rsquo;s cheating Mr. Silverton&mdash;and
then trying to throw the blame on the Cubs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be in on some sort of crooked deal,&rdquo;
Brad said slowly. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re jumping to pretty
fancy conclusions. After all, we don&rsquo;t have any real
evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We heard what those two men said,&rdquo; Brad declared
excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Brad evenly, &ldquo;but they didn&rsquo;t mention
any names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One called the other Jake,&rdquo; Dan recalled. &ldquo;Of
course, that&rsquo;s not much to go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saul Dobbs&rsquo; name wasn&rsquo;t spoken,&rdquo; Brad went
on. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like the man, so naturally we decide
he&rsquo;s in on something shady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think we should do?&rdquo; Dan asked,
willing to follow the older boy&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether we should make any accusations
or not,&rdquo; Brad returned doubtfully. &ldquo;One
can&rsquo;t go around accusing persons on flimsy evidence.
I guess the best thing to do is saying nothing until
we&rsquo;ve had a chance to report this to Mr. Hatfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about this crate of pheasants?&rdquo; Dan asked.
&ldquo;Shall we put it back in the lean-to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to do that. Those birds need food
and water right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not take &rsquo;em to the barn and turn them
loose with the other pheasants?&rdquo; Dan suggested.
&ldquo;Then we can explain to Mr. Silverton later on, if
we need to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea!&rdquo; approved Brad. &ldquo;Come on,
let&rsquo;s move along and find out what&rsquo;s happened to
Chips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carrying the crate of pheasants, the three retraced
their way along the dark path. At the masked
entrance, there was no sign of Chips.</p>
<p>Brad whistled softly and the boys came quickly
out of hiding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did those men go after they left here?&rdquo;
Brad questioned. &ldquo;Did you see &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Chips answered, staring at the crate of
pheasants which Red and Dan carried between
them. &ldquo;They were plenty mad about something
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But which way did they go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back toward the log jam and the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure hope Mack and Fred kept out of sight,&rdquo;
Brad said anxiously.</p>
<p>As the four started for the creek, he explained to
Chips what they had seen and heard near the
lean-to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you recognize either of those two men?&rdquo; he
asked Chips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly could see their faces, Brad. They were
hopping mad because you hid the crate of pheasants.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>At the creek, Mack and Fred who had taken
refuge among the oak trees, came out of hiding as
the other Cubs emerged from the trail.</p>
<p>Excitedly they reported that the two men had
crossed the log bridge only a few minutes before,
wading through the deepening water to the parked
station wagon on the old road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get the license number?&rdquo; Dan inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Fred explained. &ldquo;Too dark to see
that far. And the men never turned on their car
lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had a hard time getting the motor started,&rdquo;
Mack contributed. &ldquo;The driver got mad and began
berating the other fellow. Oh, they were heated!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hear any names spoken?&rdquo; Brad questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Names?&rdquo; Mack repeated. &ldquo;Well, one of &rsquo;em
called the other Bernie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s two names we have now!&rdquo; Red exclaimed.
&ldquo;Jake and Bernie. Ever hear of anyone by either
of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>None of the Cubs had. Mack thought it possible
that the pair were known to Mr. Silverton, and in
fact, might have been employed by him to do work
on the farm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s possible, of course,&rdquo; Brad conceded. &ldquo;But
if they were farm workers, why would they talk
about being double crossed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although nearly a half hour had elapsed since
Mr. Hatfield and the sportsman had gone to the
house in search of dynamite, neither had returned.
During their absence, Mack and Fred had made an
effort to dislodge some of the logs which were causing
the water to back up. Their attempts however,
had been unavailing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The creek still is rising,&rdquo; Fred declared as the
Cubs waded across the piled-up debris to the other
side of the stream. &ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s happened to
Mr. Hatfield and Silverton?&rdquo; Answering his own
question, he added: &ldquo;They may have had to go into
the city after dynamite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talking over the matter, it was agreed that Mack,
Fred, Red and Chips would wait at the log jam,
doing what they could to release the smaller tree
branches. Brad and Dan were to carry the crate of
pheasants to the barn, and if they could find Mr.
Silverton, report to him what they had seen and
heard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Splashing through the knee-deep water, the two
boys picked their way through the darkness. Once,
stumbling over a submerged tree stump, Dan nearly
dropped his end of the shipping crate.</p>
<p>But finally, with no mishap, they reached the
clearing.</p>
<p>The rising water now had flooded all the pheasant
pens and was creating a large island of the house
and barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the creek keeps coming up, water will start
filtering into the barn in another hour or so,&rdquo; Brad
said anxiously. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll need the Cubs to help
move the pheasants into the loft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s car was nowhere to be seen, a fact
which led the two boys to believe that the Cub
leader and Mr. Silverton had driven away to obtain
dynamite.</p>
<p>At the barn, Brad and Dan opened the crate and
turned loose the two cocks which were absorbed in
the flock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing we can do here,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;I
suppose we may as well go back to the creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the pair turned to leave, they heard footsteps
outside the barn door. Thinking that it was Mr. Hatfield
or Mr. Silverton, Dan called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are! In the barn!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>No one answered his shout. But a moment later,
the door of the barn was flung back, and the boys
found themselves gazing into the blinding light of
a gasoline lantern.</p>
<p>A massive, squat figure, whose shadow was grotesque,
stood silhouetted in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s you again, my young friends!&rdquo; observed
a harsh, mocking voice. &ldquo;This time I&rsquo;ve caught you
red handed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad and Dan could not see the man&rsquo;s face for
the glare of the lantern. But there was no mistaking
the voice. The one who confronted them from the
doorway was Saul Dobbs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER 13</span>
<br />Accusations</h2>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve been stealing pheasants while I was
away!&rdquo; the workman accused the startled boys.
&ldquo;This time you won&rsquo;t get off with excuses! I&rsquo;m turning
you over to the police on a delinquency charge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saul Dobbs set the lighted lantern on the floor
and moved toward Brad and Dan. Before he could
lay hands upon them, the barn door creaked behind
the foreman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; demanded a familiar
voice.</p>
<p>Dobbs whirled around to see Mr. Silverton and
Sam Hatfield standing directly behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I caught &rsquo;em this time, Mr. Silverton,&rdquo; the workman
said in keen satisfaction. &ldquo;When I found &rsquo;em
here, they were stealing the pheasants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; Mr. Silverton reprimanded him. &ldquo;If it
hadn&rsquo;t been for the Cubs, two thirds of my pheasants
would have drowned. Where, may I ask, have you
been?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Dobbs lost some of his assurance. &ldquo;Why, I drove
into town for a few minutes,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;The
storm came up suddenly. As soon as I could get
back here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s taken you long enough,&rdquo; Mr. Silverton retorted.
&ldquo;Your job was to stay here. Where were
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;that is&mdash;I had an appointment with a
friend. It&mdash;it was just personal business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And while you were attending to your personal
business, the pheasant runs were flooding. You
knew that the creek was choked with logs and
debris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Silverton pinned him
down. &ldquo;The Cubs discovered it on their first visit
here. Unless the dam is dynamited, the water will
keep rising for hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what can be done right away,&rdquo; Dobbs
said, reaching for the lantern.</p>
<p>As he stooped, his gaze fell upon the shipping
crate which Dan and Brad had deposited on the
floor only a few minutes before. His attention fastened
upon it only momentarily, and then deliberately
he looked away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>However, both Brad and Dan had seen the
glance, and it dawned upon them that the foreman
had knowledge of the crate having been left in the
lean-to.</p>
<p>Despite the urgency of getting back to the creek
to dynamite the log jam, Brad determined to bring
up the matter then and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan and I very easily can explain why we&rsquo;re
here&mdash;&rdquo; he began, only to have Mr. Silverton interrupt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for you to explain to Dobbs,
boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we feel you should know, sir,&rdquo; Dan broke
in. &ldquo;We brought two cocks which we found across
the creek in a shipping crate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a shipping crate?&rdquo; the owner of the pheasant
farm repeated in a puzzled voice.</p>
<p>Dan explained how he and Brad had come upon
the hidden path, and of seeing the two strangers
who had complained of being double-crossed when
they failed to find the crated pheasants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dobbs, what do you know of this matter?&rdquo; his
employer demanded severely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, not a thing.&rdquo; The foreman laughed nervously.
&ldquo;Not a thing. We built a little lean-to about
a year ago where I sometimes keep a few tools.
Haven&rsquo;t used it in months or been near there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me nothing of having built the shack,
Dobbs. In fact, I find there are many things you
neglected to report. Who are the men who have
been trespassing on my property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Dobbs whined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never
seen anyone use the old logging road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mention was made of anyone using it,&rdquo; Brad
tripped him up. &ldquo;However, that&rsquo;s how they have
been coming here&mdash;down the road at night, crossing
the log bridge afoot and then apparently to the
lean-to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t so!&rdquo; Dobbs denied, suddenly losing
control of his temper. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just saying it to make
trouble for me. You want me to lose my job! You&rsquo;re
sore because I told Mr. Silverton about the Cubs
trespassing on the restricted area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re reporting exactly what we saw,&rdquo; Brad
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you describe the two men?&rdquo; Mr. Silverton
asked, paying no attention to Dobbs&rsquo; accusation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One was heavy set and about middle age,&rdquo; Brad
recalled. &ldquo;The other was taller. We couldn&rsquo;t see their
faces plainly because it was so dark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They called each other Jake and Bernie,&rdquo; Dan
contributed.</p>
<p>The names struck sparks in Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Bernie Bauer and Jake Freeze?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t hear the last names, sir,&rdquo; Dan returned
regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, your general description fits the
pair,&rdquo; Mr. Silverton said, turning again to the crestfallen
foreman. &ldquo;Friends of yours, aren&rsquo;t they,
Dobbs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Bernard Bauer and Jake Freeze slightly,&rdquo;
Dobbs replied, considering his words carefully. &ldquo;But
believe me, Mr. Silverton, they&rsquo;ve never come here.
At least not to my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve suspected for a long while that someone
was stealing some of my best pheasants, Dobbs. In
fact, we discussed it several times. But it remained
for the Cubs to bring the proof I needed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proof! What proof have they dug up? How do
we know they didn&rsquo;t make up the whole story about
finding those cocks in the lean-to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll vouch for the honesty of Brad and Dan,&rdquo;
said Mr. Hatfield, who had listened silently to the
discussion. &ldquo;For that matter, their findings do not
surprise me. I&rsquo;ve suspected for some time that trespassers
were using the old logging road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>While the Cub leader spoke, Dan by the light of
the lantern had been inspecting the pheasant crate.
Now he was ready to spring his most important
discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want proof that someone has been stealing
pheasants, look at this!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Attached to the shipping crate with a bit of wire
was the torn half of an old tag, showing that it had
been expressed to Malborne.</p>
<p>In the wavering light of the lantern, Mr. Hatfield
and the owner of the pheasant farm inspected the
writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found the other half of this shipping tag on
the old logging road several days ago,&rdquo; Dan told Mr.
Silverton. &ldquo;Apparently, the crate has been used repeatedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield, who had kept the missing half of
the tag, removed it from his billfold and gave it to
Mr. Silverton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously, pheasants have been shipped out for
resale,&rdquo; the sportsman said. &ldquo;This convinces me.
And I rather think Freeze and Bauer are our boys!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs have given you a twisted story,&rdquo;
Dobbs whined. &ldquo;I tell you I never saw this pheasant
crate before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dobbs, you&rsquo;re lying!&rdquo; Mr. Silverton accused him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen that crate myself. Isn&rsquo;t it one we kept as
an extra? I remember one of the slats was broken.
You mended it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here is the repaired place,&rdquo; Dan pointed
it out.</p>
<p>Thus tripped in his story, Dobbs began to stammer
and make the excuse that he had failed to
recognize the crate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of your alibis,&rdquo; Mr. Silverton
said angrily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do the rest of your explaining
to the police!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t turn me over to the authorities, Mr. Silverton,&rdquo;
the man pleaded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked for you two
years&mdash;doing the best I could. I did make mistakes&mdash;I
admit it, and the worst one was ever getting acquainted
with those two yellow dogs, Jake Freeze
and Bernie Bauer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere, Dobbs. So you
admit you worked with them in stealing my pheasants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I tell you the whole story, will you let me
off?&rdquo; Dobbs tried to bargain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; his employer returned coldly. &ldquo;Unless
you do tell me, I&rsquo;ll call the police. I promise you
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dobbs drew a deep breath and said sullenly:
&ldquo;Well, it was like this: I knew Freeze and Bauer
several years ago before I came to work for you.
During the war I was employed by a man named
Willis who had an estate north of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of him,&rdquo; Silverton nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had deer in his forest. Meat was scarce then,
and it seemed a shame for folks to go without, just
for want of a few ration stamps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you made a deal to supply deer to Freeze and
Bauer?&rdquo; Mr. Silverton demanded, guessing at the
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the size of it,&rdquo; Dobbs admitted.
&ldquo;Only they came to me with the proposition. I
never liked the business, so I pulled out and came
to Webster City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you got mixed up in pheasant stealing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not intentionally. Believe me, Mr. Silverton, I&rsquo;ve
worked hard trying to keep things running smoothly
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You receive a generous salary for your work,
I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t complaining,&rdquo; Dobbs said uncomfortably.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been decent to me&mdash;mighty
decent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get mixed up with Freeze and
Bauer again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They learned I was working for you and followed
me here. At first I wouldn&rsquo;t listen to &rsquo;em, but
they kept threatening if I didn&rsquo;t play along, they&rsquo;d
tip off to you about my previous black market activities.
Then I knew I&rsquo;d lose my job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you made a deal with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They forced me into it. I never got much out
of it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long has this stealing been going on,
Dobbs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only since last fall. At first Freeze and Bauer
didn&rsquo;t take many pheasants. Lately, they&rsquo;ve pressured
me into letting them have more and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pheasants were shipped out of town for
sale, just as the Cubs thought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where they were sold,&rdquo; Dobbs said.
&ldquo;Freeze and Bauer never told me any of the details
of their business, and I didn&rsquo;t ask. Mostly they
drove in here at night, using the old logging
road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You let them know when the coast was clear, so
to speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They made me do that. But believe me, Mr.
Silverton, I never let &rsquo;em have as many pheasants
as they wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very considerate of my interests,&rdquo; the sportsman
said sarcastically. &ldquo;You knew about the log jam in
the creek, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freeze and Bauer put the logs in so they could
cross the stream at that point and reach the lean-to.
I was afraid it might make trouble, but I didn&rsquo;t
look for the rains to be so heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You left the two pheasant cocks in the lean-to
and then went away late this afternoon? That was
to give your friends a chance to come here while
you were away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t friends of mine,&rdquo; Dobbs insisted. &ldquo;I
told you, they&rsquo;ve been making life mighty hard for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do the two live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a little hotel on Brady Avenue in Webster
City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear out a warrant for their arrest immediately,&rdquo;
Mr. Silverton declared. &ldquo;As for you,
Dobbs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hard on me,&rdquo; the workman pleaded.
&ldquo;I told you the whole truth. I never would have got
mixed up in the dirty business only they kept after
me. I&rsquo;ll be glad to see &rsquo;em behind bars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you testify against them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will if you&rsquo;ll let me off, Mr. Silverton. I swear
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the sportsman agreed, impatient to
be finished with the discussion. &ldquo;I want no scandal,
so I&rsquo;ll let you off. But understand this! You&rsquo;re
through here&mdash;fired. Now get out! My secretary will
send you your final pay check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mr. Silverton,&rdquo; Dobbs mumbled, shuffling
toward the door.</p>
<p>His heavy boots sloshed through a trickle of
water which had seeped unnoticed into the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The creek&rsquo;s still rising!&rdquo; he exclaimed, startled.</p>
<p>As Dobbs thrust open the barn door, more water
trickled in.</p>
<p>Mr. Silverton seized the lantern from the floor. As
he flashed it out-of-doors, he saw that the entire
area near the house and barn was flooded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming up fast!&rdquo; he exclaimed in dismay.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to dynamite the log jam right away or
the water will keep rising!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER 14</span>
<br />Trouble on Rabb Island</h2>
<p>The rapidity with which the creek waters had
flooded the low area and the higher ground where
the barn was situated, alarmed Mr. Silverton and
Sam Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Fred?&rdquo; the Cub leader asked anxiously.
&ldquo;And the other boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We left them at the creek, not far from the log
jam,&rdquo; Dan explained. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve probably moved to
higher ground somewhere along the old logging
road. We told them to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get back there and work fast!&rdquo; Mr.
Silverton said, starting hurriedly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton, let me dynamite the jam for you,&rdquo;
Dobbs offered unexpectedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous work
and you ain&rsquo;t used to handling the stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Silverton hesitated, apparently on the verge
of refusing the request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please let me help,&rdquo; Dobbs urged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the least
I can do to make amends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; the sportsman agreed. &ldquo;We need
your help. The dynamite is in my car. Be careful it
doesn&rsquo;t get wet, because it&rsquo;s all I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set off the blast,&rdquo; Dobbs said, starting away.
&ldquo;Just be sure all the boys are out of range when she
goes off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll round the Cubs up now,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said. &ldquo;What about these pheasants here in the
barn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan and I can move them up into the loft,&rdquo; Brad
offered eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can dynamite the dam, it may not be
necessary,&rdquo; Mr. Silverton said. &ldquo;First, let&rsquo;s see what
can be done at the creek. If we fail there, we&rsquo;ll have
to come back and move everything out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dobbs obtained the dynamite from Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s
car, and the party set off for the creek. Failing
to see Fred, Mack, Chips and Red by the dam, Mr.
Hatfield gave the familiar Pack whistle.</p>
<p>From higher land far up the logging road came
an immediate response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Round up the Cubs, Brad,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield instructed
the Den Chief. &ldquo;Then keep them all together
until after Dobbs sets off the dynamite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Brad agreed. &ldquo;Coming, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>Leaving the log jam where an avalanche of water
was pouring over the pile of debris, the two boys
quickly found the other four Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought you never would get back,&rdquo; Red
said. He was wet to the waist and covered with
mud, having fallen down on the slippery road. &ldquo;The
creek came up so fast, we moved out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad and Dan recounted their own experiences
at the barn, and ended by telling Dobbs&rsquo; confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all the while that guy was trying to put the
blame on us!&rdquo; Chips exclaimed indignantly. &ldquo;What
a nerve! He drove us away from here because he
was afraid we&rsquo;d learn the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we did, thanks to Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s suspicions
about the logging road,&rdquo; declared Brad. &ldquo;But if
Dan hadn&rsquo;t noticed the shipping tag on that crate,
I doubt Dobbs ever would have confessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to Freeze and Bauer?&rdquo; Fred
questioned. &ldquo;They got away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Temporarily,&rdquo; Brad answered. &ldquo;Mr. Silverton
knows their address though. So unless they wise up
and slip out of town, he&rsquo;ll swear out a warrant for
their arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Keeping together, the Cubs returned to the creek,
the banks of which had dissolved into a dark,
murky, ever-spreading lake.</p>
<p>On the log jam, endeavoring to place the charge
of dynamite, were Dobbs, Sam Hatfield and Mr.
Silverton. Seeing the Cubs, Mr. Hatfield shouted to
Brad to come and hold the lighted lantern. The
others, he warned to keep far away.</p>
<p>Carefully Dobbs placed the dynamite charge,
having trouble in keeping it dry until the fuse could
be lighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now everyone get out of here quick!&rdquo; he ordered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sticking until the last minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the long fuse began to burn, Mr. Silverton,
Brad, and Sam Hatfield, quickly waded back to the
waiting Cubs. Together, all retreated a safe distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Dobbs!&rdquo; Mr. Silverton shouted to the
workman. &ldquo;Better get out. That fuse will burn fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus urged, Dobbs leaped off the logs and started
at a run through the water. Gasping for breath, he
reached the Cubs.</p>
<p>With increasing tenseness, everyone waited for
the explosion. Minutes passed and it did not come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fuse has damped out,&rdquo; Dobbs muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go back and see what&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, wait!&rdquo; Mr. Silverton commanded, placing a
restraining hand on the man&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, there came a terrific blast
which shook the ground where the Cubs stood.
Logs were hurled helter-skelter as the pile of debris
broke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s moving out!&rdquo; Dobbs cried jubilantly.</p>
<p>Wading to the stream&rsquo;s edge, the Cubs watched
the splintered logs float off downstream.</p>
<p>A few of the larger pieces at either side of the
jam had not been dislodged by the blast, but the
gap was large enough for the main flow of the torrent
to pour through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water level will lower rapidly now,&rdquo; Mr.
Silverton said in satisfaction.</p>
<p>Soon the Cubs observed for themselves that damp
rings were appearing on the bases of the trunks
of nearby trees, indicating that the flood was receding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The danger here is past,&rdquo; declared Mr. Hatfield.
&ldquo;But on the river, I fear it&rsquo;s a different story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose the Holloway place is under
water?&rdquo; Brad asked anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not the house,&rdquo; the Cub leader replied. &ldquo;But the
cabin may be flooded. If not by this time, it may
a little later. The river rises slowly, but for days
now it has been almost at bank level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we go there and see if Mr. Holloway
needs help?&rdquo; Dan suggested. &ldquo;A lot of Cub stuff is
stored in the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Including that Indian headgear Red and I
made!&rdquo; Chips contributed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sure hate to lose it
just before the Pack handicraft show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of that feather headgear, I owe the
Cubs an apology,&rdquo; Mr. Silverton said. &ldquo;Several of
them, in fact. There&rsquo;s no time to speak of certain
matters now, but later on, you&rsquo;ll hear from me. In
the meantime, thanks for everything you&rsquo;ve done
tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs, eager to reach Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s place,
said good-bye and left the sportsman and Dobbs at
the creek. Returning to Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s parked car,
they rode with the Cub leader into Webster City,
and on toward the outskirts.</p>
<p>As the highway curved near the river, the Cubs
noted with increasing anxiety that large areas of
low-lying shore had been nibbled away.</p>
<p>Finally, at the Holloway residence, they piled out
of the car to see lighted lanterns moving in the
vicinity of the log cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield and the Cubs trooped down the
slope to find Midge, his father, and Mrs. Holloway,
moving bedding, furniture and knickknacks from
the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; Midge&rsquo;s father greeted the
newcomers. &ldquo;From the look of your clothes, you&rsquo;ve
already had a bout with this flood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A winning one, we&rsquo;re glad to report!&rdquo; the Cub
leader laughed. &ldquo;Need help here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly do, although for the moment the
situation is fairly well in hand. But I&rsquo;m worried
about the folks on Rabb Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The island of which Mr. Holloway spoke was
situated in mid-river only a short distance downstream
from the Cub&rsquo;s cabin. Until recently it had
been unoccupied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I didn&rsquo;t know anyone lived there,&rdquo; Dan
said in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A family of four moved in about three weeks
ago,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway revealed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re living in a
shack there&mdash;the mother and father and two youngsters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rabb Island is low,&rdquo; the Cub leader said. &ldquo;And
the river has risen several feet in the last few hours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Dustin family has a boat of sorts,&rdquo; Mr.
Holloway said. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t worry, only I know Mr.
Dustin went away late this afternoon just before the
storm broke. Whether he got back or not, I don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Mrs. Dustin and the two children might
be on the island alone?&rdquo; Mr. Holloway asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s worrying me. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any way we can find out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to row over there as soon as I get things
cleaned up here. But the water&rsquo;s risen so fast I
haven&rsquo;t had a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go over right away and check up,&rdquo; volunteered
the Cub leader. &ldquo;That is, if I can borrow the
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midge and I hauled it up by the boat house. The
dock is under water now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help you get it out,&rdquo; Dan offered eagerly.
&ldquo;Need anyone to go along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only take one Cub, because I may need
to bring passengers back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me,&rdquo; urged Chips, who had just come out
of the flooded cabin after having rescued the Indian
feather headdress. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good rower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than I am,&rdquo; conceded Dan as he saw Mr.
Hatfield hesitate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Chips, you may go along,&rdquo; agreed the
Cub leader. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s launch the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs carried the craft to the water&rsquo;s edge.
Chips climbed in with Mr. Hatfield who took possession
of the oars. The Cubs then gave a mighty
shove which sent the boat well on its way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That dope!&rdquo; Red exclaimed belatedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is?&rdquo; demanded Brad who stood near the
submerged dock watching the boat disappear into
the darkness of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chips! Didn&rsquo;t he take our Indian headdress with
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did have it in his hand,&rdquo; declared Dan. &ldquo;But
it should be safe enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless he absently drops it into the river! Or the
boat may leak and the feathers get wet. We did a
lot of work on that headdress. Only this morning
Mr. Holloway told me he thought it might be one
of the best items entered in the Pack exhibition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; Brad advised.
&ldquo;Chips thinks a lot of that headdress too. Depend
upon it, he&rsquo;ll take care of those precious feathers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the boat had vanished beyond view, the
Cubs returned to the cabin to see if anything had
been left undone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Every object which possibly might suffer damage
from the rising water, already had been removed
to the Holloway home on the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cabin itself can&rsquo;t be injured by water,&rdquo; Mr.
Holloway told the boys. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s likely to be left
in a dirty mess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make a date right now to help you clean
the place,&rdquo; Dan offered. &ldquo;Everyone show up at the
next Cub meeting armed with a mop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because Brad and Dan were soaked through, Mrs.
Holloway insisted that they change clothing before
starting home. Midge&rsquo;s extra Cub uniform was a
fair fit for Dan, while Brad borrowed garments from
Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s wardrobe. The other Cubs were
provided with changes of socks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry I can&rsquo;t give you all complete outfits,&rdquo; Mrs.
Holloway said regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; Mack told her. &ldquo;Our folks will be
coming for us in a few minutes anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the Cubs were waiting for the arrival of
their parents, Mrs. Holloway brewed hot chocolate
and made sandwiches. In the warm kitchen, the
boys consumed great quantities of food, and recounted
the story of their exciting pheasant hunt at
Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s farm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, shouldn&rsquo;t Mr. Hatfield and Chips be getting
back?&rdquo; Dan presently asked, glancing at the
kitchen clock. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been gone a long while, or
so it seems to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking the same thing,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Holloway.
&ldquo;Suppose we go down to the river again and
see if the boat is coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the others to dry out by the stove, Dan
and Mr. Holloway went down to the water&rsquo;s edge.
The river lapped angrily at their feet. As far as they
could see there was no sign of a returning boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use to worry,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
be coming along any minute&mdash;unless they should
have run into a bad situation on the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river&rsquo;s still rising,&rdquo; Dan observed. &ldquo;Though
not as fast as it was an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He and Mr. Holloway took a last look out across
the river toward Rabb Island and then turned away.
On the steps leading to the house, Dan felt a strange
compulsion to pause and once more gaze over his
shoulder.</p>
<p>As he did so, he saw several flashes of light from
the direction of the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Mr. Holloway!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I saw
something just then!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>Excitedly, he indicated the direction from whence
the flashes had come. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell exactly what it
was, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the pair returned to the water&rsquo;s edge,
watching intently and waiting. Perhaps three minutes
elapsed and then a dim light blinked on and
off several times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be a flashlight!&rdquo; Mr. Holloway said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly coming from Rabb Island or close
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Mr. Hatfield is trying to signal us! I
know he had a flashlight in his pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like code,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway declared as
the signals again were seen. &ldquo;Morse code. Can you
read it, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but Brad can. He studied it in scouting last
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then get him! But be quick about it. Those
flashes are becoming weaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requiring no urging, Dan darted up the stone
steps two at a time, bursting into the Holloway
kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come quick, Brad!&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Someone is signaling
from Rabb Island in Morse code. We need
you to read it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Not only Brad but all the Cubs poured out of the
kitchen and ran down to the river.</p>
<p>The flashes of light still were visible from across
the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you make them out, Brad?&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that we read the message.
Mr. Hatfield and Chips may have run into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flashes are so weak,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get
it. Yes, now I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;BOAT LOST. SEND&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boat lost! Send help!&rdquo; Dan finished as the flashes
faded completely and did not reappear. &ldquo;Chips and
Mr. Hatfield must have reached the island, but
they&rsquo;re in trouble. We&rsquo;ve got to get to them right
away!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER 15</span>
<br />The Grand Howl</h2>
<p>Alarmed for the safety of Chips, Mr. Hatfield
and the dwellers of Rabb Island, Mr. Holloway immediately
telephoned the Coast Guard station for
assistance. He was assured that a rescue boat would
be sent immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will take them at least a half hour to reach the
island,&rdquo; the Den Dad reported to the Cubs. &ldquo;Meanwhile,
a lot may be happening there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Decidedly worried, Mr. Holloway and the Cubs
established a vigil on the river front. The flashlight
signals from Rabb Island were not repeated. This
however, was no consolation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s flashlight battery probably is so
weak it won&rsquo;t operate,&rdquo; Brad said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, can&rsquo;t we borrow a boat from somewhere
and row over there?&rdquo; Dan demanded, made anxious
by the long wait. &ldquo;Dorman Clark keeps a motor
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But his place is two miles down stream,&rdquo; Mr.
Holloway reminded the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would take us longer than thirty minutes to
get there, launch the boat, and beat our way upstream
to Rabb Island,&rdquo; Brad objected.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Our best
bet is to wait here for the Coast Guard launch,&rdquo; he
decided, &ldquo;even though it&rsquo;s hard to remain idle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little more was said by the Cubs although their
anxiety was far from relieved. Wandering up and
down the shore, they repeatedly checked the level
of the water. Slowly but steadily, the river was
creeping higher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two years ago when the floods came, Rabb
Island was almost entirely submerged,&rdquo; Brad remarked,
gazing anxiously at Mr. Holloway. &ldquo;Do you
think there is danger it might be covered again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river was at least two feet higher then,
Brad. There&rsquo;s no immediate danger of the entire
island being flooded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not positive Mr. Hatfield and Chips
reached the island, though the signals appeared to
come from there,&rdquo; Mack remarked. &ldquo;If we interpreted
the message right, something happened to
the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t figure,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;Do you
suppose it sprung a leak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possible, but hardly likely,&rdquo; the Den Dad replied.
&ldquo;That boat was tight as a drum. I caulked the
seams myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Brad suddenly shouted. &ldquo;I see a light on
the river!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other Cubs turned to gaze where he pointed.
Far across the water they could see a bright, moving
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Coast Guard launch,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway said
in relief.</p>
<p>Plowing slowly upstream against the turbulent
waters, the launch kept to midstream, churning on
through the darkness toward Rabb Island.</p>
<p>Their minds now partially relieved, the Cubs nevertheless
waited in suspense along the shore, wondering
what might be amiss.</p>
<p>Finally, after at least another twenty minutes, the
rescue craft was seen to put off from the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s heading this way!&rdquo; Brad observed.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, churning up spume, the
launch halted well beyond the shallows opposite
the submerged Holloway dock. In short order a
small boat was lowered. Aboard were Sam Hatfield,
Chips, Mrs. Dustin, her two small children, and a
very bedraggled dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Mr. Holloway demanded as
he and the Cubs waded out to pull the boat up onto
land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s quite a story,&rdquo; the Cub leader replied,
carefully assisting Mrs. Dustin from the boat. &ldquo;Before
I go into it, suppose we get this lady and her
children into the house. They&rsquo;ve had a harrowing
time of it on the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dustin brushed aside a wisp of damp hair
which had blown across her drawn, care-lined face.
She wore a man&rsquo;s coat over her housedress, but the
latter was soaked from the knees down and clung
to her as she walked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband went to Webster City late this
afternoon and couldn&rsquo;t get back,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;Then the river came up frightfully fast. It flooded
our little place, ruining everything. The children
and I had to take refuge on the highest point of
the island. I don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;d have done, if
help hadn&rsquo;t come when it did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Holloway slipped an arm about the woman&rsquo;s
shaking shoulders as she led her and the two small
children toward the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about anything now,&rdquo; she comforted.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll spend the night here and we&rsquo;ll get
word to your husband. We have plenty of room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having delivered the passengers safely, the Coast
Guard launch now prepared to pull away, but not
before Sam Hatfield and Mr. Holloway both had
thanked the crew for the timely rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just part of our job,&rdquo; the boatswain replied
carelessly. &ldquo;Glad to have been of service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the launch had disappeared in the darkness,
Brad and the other Cubs gathered about Mr. Hatfield,
urging him to relate what had occurred on
Rabb Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s boat?&rdquo; Dan
asked. &ldquo;And why was it necessary to send the distress
message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; the Cub leader hesitated, glancing
briefly at Chips. &ldquo;Oh, we had a little bad luck. The
boat broke away after we left it on shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t bad luck exactly,&rdquo; Chips corrected
quietly. &ldquo;I was careless. Mr. Hatfield told me to
fasten the boat, and I did tie it to a dock post&mdash;only
not securely enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t really your fault, Chips,&rdquo; the Cub
leader said generously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was, sir. I should have been more careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accidents can happen to anyone, Chips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of the boat?&rdquo; Dan asked although
he knew the question was a rather useless one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it drifted off somewhere downstream,&rdquo; the
Cub leader replied. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re lucky, it may lodge
some place fairly close. Then again, this swift current
is likely to carry it miles. If any damage is done
I&rsquo;ll either buy a new boat or see that it is properly
repaired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t give that a thought,&rdquo; the Den Dad
cut in. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find the boat tomorrow.&rdquo; He turned
to Chips, clapping him on the shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look
so glum, lad. No one blames you for the accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just the boat I&rsquo;m thinking about,&rdquo; the
boy answered. &ldquo;The Indian headdress was lying on
the seat when it floated away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there goes the Den&rsquo;s chance to win first
prize at the Pack exhibition!&rdquo; exclaimed Red. &ldquo;Gosh!
After all the work we did on that headdress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to lose it?&rdquo; Fred asked in
a discouraged voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>Chips explained that he had left the feather piece
lying on the boat seat when he and Mr. Hatfield
had gone to the rescue of Mrs. Dustin and her two
children. Upon their return, both the boat and the
headdress had floated away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never enter it in the competition now,&rdquo; he
ended in disgust. &ldquo;The boat may be found, but the
headdress is sure to be a mess after lying out all
night in the weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loss of the handicraft article upon which the Den
had pinned hope of victory in the Pack exhibition,
thoroughly discouraged the Cubs. However, because
Chips already blamed himself for the loss,
they said little about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an outside chance the boat may have
lodged at the Fulton bridge, a quarter of a mile
down river,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield remarked thoughtfully.
&ldquo;The current would carry it in that direction. I think
I&rsquo;ll drive that way on my way home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad and Dan immediately sought permission to
accompany the Cub leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to have you,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said.
&ldquo;Better telephone your parents and tell them not to
bother to pick you up. I&rsquo;ll drive you home after
we&rsquo;ve looked for the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Eager to be off, Mr. Hatfield borrowed a lantern
from Midge&rsquo;s father. With Brad and Dan, he then
selected the main highway which would take the
car across the Fulton bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late for us to make an extensive search
for the boat tonight,&rdquo; he remarked as they drove
along. &ldquo;The chances are it will drift miles from
Rabb Island. All the same, we&rsquo;ll keep our eyes
peeled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the pale light of the moon, the boys caught
occasional glimpses of the racing river. At the
bridge where rolling waves dashed against the stone
supports, Mr. Hatfield halted the car for a better
view.</p>
<p>Gazing down over the cement railing, Dan and
Brad saw boxes, boards, logs and miscellaneous
debris swept past. Other refuse of the river had
lodged in quieter waters. Foam rose in a soapy sea
around the bridge pillars where the waves slapped
high.</p>
<p>But there was no sign of the missing boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess it was too much to expect,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said, turning away from the railing. &ldquo;Well, nothing
to do but organize a search tomorrow. I&rsquo;m afraid
though, that the boat will be badly battered by the
time we recover it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield and the Cubs returned to the parked
automobile and drove on. For a short distance the
highway curled close to the rivers edge. At one
point, shallow water flooded the pavement.</p>
<p>The car churned through it without the engine
damping out. But a short distance ahead they came
to another area of flooded pavement, more extensive
and apparently much deeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if we can make it?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield remarked.</p>
<p>Doubtful that the car could negotiate the water,
he parked and walked down the road to investigate.
Brad and Dan also alighted, following the Cub
leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We probably can get through all right,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said after making an inspection. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s
likely to be more water ahead. Perhaps we&rsquo;d better
go back and take another road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Brad and the Cub leader discussed what to
do, Dan, who had been gazing out across the dark
ribbon of river, suddenly noticed a shadowy object
lodged some ten yards from shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Look over there!
Could that be our missing boat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>The Cub leader flashed his light on the area in the
river which Dan indicated. A rowboat, plainly the
one which had floated away from Rabb Island, had
snagged against a bush in the backwash of the
flooded river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough, it&rsquo;s Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s boat!&rdquo; the Cub
leader exclaimed. &ldquo;You have keen eyesight, Dan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boat doesn&rsquo;t look as if it will hold there very
long,&rdquo; Brad observed anxiously. &ldquo;See! The current is
teetering it back and forth now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we had another boat, we could go after
it,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;By morning, it may not be
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the three watched, the swift current caught the
craft and swung it slightly to the left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s holding by a breath and a prayer,&rdquo; Dan said.
&ldquo;Any minute it will float away and that may be the
last we&rsquo;ll ever see of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we wade out and bring the boat in?&rdquo;
proposed Brad. &ldquo;The current is swift, but the water
shouldn&rsquo;t be too deep here close to shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over your head and mine part of the way,
Brad. And neither of us classifies as an expert
swimmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do,&rdquo; spoke up Dan. Then he corrected himself:
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to hold myself out as an expert,
but I&rsquo;m considered pretty good at the Y. Mr. Hatfield,
I could take off my shoes and wade out there.
I wouldn&rsquo;t have to swim except the last few yards.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too dangerous, Dan. The current is treacherously
swift. It might sweep you past the boat and on
down river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I don&rsquo;t try, we&rsquo;ll lose the boat,&rdquo; Dan
argued. &ldquo;And the Indian feather headdress! The
Cubs were counting on it to win the Pack handicraft
exhibition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s boat is worth considerable
money,&rdquo; Brad added, swinging toward support of
Dan&rsquo;s plea. &ldquo;If only we could get it now before it&rsquo;s
damaged&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I could swim out there,&rdquo; Dan argued. &ldquo;At
the Y I&rsquo;ve done three times that distance without
even tiring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not in a swift current, Dan,&rdquo; the Cub leader
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be swimming downstream, not against the
current, Mr. Hatfield. Please let me try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, it&rsquo;s too risky. If I could swim worth a cent
myself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re afraid
to let me try. I know my own strength in the water.
I can do it easily.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield smiled and stood a moment studying
the current which eddied about the half-submerged
bush and the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe there&rsquo;s a rope in the back of the car,&rdquo;
he said finally. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s long enough we may be able
to do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fetching the rope, he coiled it carefully and tested
its length by tossing it far out into the river. It fell
only a few feet short of the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My throw was weak,&rdquo; the Cub leader said. &ldquo;The
rope actually is long enough to reach. Dan, you&rsquo;re
dead sure you want to try this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rarin&rsquo; to go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then strip to your shorts. You&rsquo;ll need freedom
of movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan eagerly pulled off his shoes and divested himself
of his outer garments. Carefully the Cub leader
then tied the rope about his waist and tested the
knot to make certain it would hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wade out as far as you can into the river,&rdquo; he
instructed the boy. &ldquo;When you have to, swim. If
you can&rsquo;t make it, Brad and I will pull you in
fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it,&rdquo; Dan said grimly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Brad and the Cub leader removed their own shoes
and socks, rolled up their trousers, and waded out
a short distance into the flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now be careful,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield warned as Dan
prepared to start on alone. &ldquo;If you find yourself in
trouble, signal with a quick tug of the rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; the boy replied confidently.</p>
<p>While Mr. Hatfield and Brad held one end of the
rope, he waded on alone, picking his way cautiously.
The muddy water washed to his knees, then to his
waist, and finally came to shoulder depth.</p>
<p>The next moment the swift current swept him
from his feet. Dan began to stroke smoothly only to
discover that the river was carrying him downstream
much too fast. Unless he exerted every ounce of his
strength, he would be carried beyond his goal.</p>
<p>Dan dug in. His arms dipped and swept downward
to his sides in powerful drives. His legs, churning
in the steady six-beat crawl, gave him added
propulsion.</p>
<p>The bush and the lodge boat loomed directly
ahead. But the current, bent on carrying him with
it, seemed to take on perverse strength. Despite his
best efforts, he saw that he would be carried past
his goal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swim, Dan!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield shouted. &ldquo;Swim hard!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Dan heard and made a supreme effort. Though
his breath was coming hard, his muscles offering
painful complaint, he deliberately forced himself
into a faster rhythm. The current swung him, but as
he passed the bush, the boy lunged for it.</p>
<p>Achieving a handhold, he clung fast. The river
swung his feet from beneath him, tugging and jerking.
But still Dan held on as he struggled to regain
his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boat, Dan!&rdquo; he heard Brad shout. &ldquo;Get it
quick! It&rsquo;s drifting away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s weight on the bush had dislodged the
craft, which now was moving slowly off down river.</p>
<p>With an indignant snort, Dan plunged downstream
in pursuit. Two strokes enabled him to grasp
the craft by its trailing painter.</p>
<p>But the next instant, both he and the boat were
brought up with a hard jerk. A sharp pain shot
through his waist where the rope had been tied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold fast to the boat!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield instructed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pull you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Against the current, the Cub leader and Brad
slowly pulled hand over hand until Dan was in
shallow, quiet water. There he was able to get to
his feet and drag the boat to shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good work, Dan!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield praised, reaching
out to help him. &ldquo;For a minute I thought you
were going to be swept past the bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; grinned Dan. &ldquo;Lucky you insisted I
tie that rope around my waist. Otherwise, I&rsquo;d have
had a hard time of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the Indian headdress?&rdquo; Brad demanded.
&ldquo;Is it safe in the boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield turned the beam of his flashlight on
the craft&rsquo;s seat. The feather piece lay exactly where
Chips had dropped it, undamaged by water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs will be glad to hear this,&rdquo; Brad said in
relief, retrieving the handicraft article. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
mighty lucky tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan untied the rope from his waist and began to
put on his clothes. Brad and Mr. Hatfield debated
what to do with the boat now that it had been
recovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too large to be taken into the car,&rdquo; the Cub
leader decided. &ldquo;I guess the best we can do tonight
is to hide it in the weeds well back from the river&rsquo;s
edge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Dan finished dressing, he and Brad carried
the craft far back from the rising water, overturning
it in a patch of high grass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come for it in a trailer the first thing tomorrow,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;During the next few hours,
the river shouldn&rsquo;t rise much higher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling well repaid for their exertion, the three
wiped the mud from their shoes and presently drove
on through the area of shallow water to a clear
stretch of pavement.</p>
<p>However, they had gone less than a quarter of a
mile, when directly ahead they sighted still another
flooded section of roadway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield, pulling up just before
he reached the sheet of water. &ldquo;This time, I&rsquo;m
afraid we&rsquo;re stuck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flooded area extended perhaps seventy-five
yards. At the deepest point of the water a station
wagon had stalled. Two men were endeavoring
without much success to push the vehicle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might lend them a hand,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield suggested.
&ldquo;No chance of getting through here ourselves.
We&rsquo;ll have to turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan had been staring fixedly at the station wagon.
&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield!&rdquo; he exclaimed excitedly. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that
the same car that&rsquo;s been going in and out of Mr.
Silverton&rsquo;s place?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It sure looks like Freeze and Bauer!&rdquo; added Brad
before the Cub leader could speak. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re stuck
like a couple of whales in a puddle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silverton intends to swear out a warrant for
their arrest,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet an Indian head cent
they&rsquo;re driving out of town and intend to skip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless we can stop them,&rdquo; said Brad, looking
hopefully at the Cub leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t start a fight without good cause,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield replied. &ldquo;If Mr. Silverton were here, or the
police&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad had noticed a lighted dwelling only a short
distance from the roadway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, why can&rsquo;t I sneak over there and telephone
Mr. Silverton!&rdquo; he proposed. &ldquo;If I get in touch with
him, maybe he&rsquo;ll decide to have those men arrested
right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Brad,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield urged, swinging
open the car door for him. &ldquo;Dan and I will stay
here and keep watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without attracting the attention of the two men,
Brad darted up the hill and was lost to view. Dan
and the Cub leader remained in the car, watching.</p>
<p>The pair in the station wagon had pushed the
vehicle for a short distance. There encountering
deeper water, they gave up in disgust.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;ve about decided to start off afoot
now,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield observed. &ldquo;In that case, they
may elude us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we try to stop them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try, Dan. But without an arrest warrant
or proof that the men are guilty of any crime, there&rsquo;s
very little we can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Brad came hurrying down the hillside
to the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reached Silverton and he&rsquo;s called police!&rdquo; he
reported breathlessly. &ldquo;A cruiser or patrol car should
come along in a few minutes. Silverton and Dobbs
are driving over too. They&rsquo;re ready to swear out a
warrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield exclaimed. &ldquo;But will we be
able to hold the pair until help gets here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freeze and his companion, apparently abandoning
all hope of pushing the station wagon to dry
pavement, had begun to unload their luggage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They <i>are</i> skipping town!&rdquo; Dan declared anxiously.
&ldquo;I guess they must have wised up after they
failed to find the crate of pheasants at Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s
place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come now,&rdquo; Brad muttered a minute
later as the two men splashed through the water
toward the car. &ldquo;Oh, heck! If we don&rsquo;t think of
something, they&rsquo;ll get away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield, however, did not intend to allow
the pair to escape without at least an attempt to
hold them. Warning the Cubs to remain in the car,
he stepped out onto the road just as the two waded
up carrying their heavy luggage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuck?&rdquo; he inquired casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; growled Jake Freeze.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get through with your car. I&rsquo;d advise
you to turn around and go back the way you came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I will,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said easily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
abandoning your station wagon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a hurry to catch a train,&rdquo; Freeze answered.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have it towed in by a garage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can give you a lift to town,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
offered, stalling for time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, we&rsquo;ll appreciate it,&rdquo; Bauer growled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
tellin&rsquo; you we&rsquo;ve had a rotten run o&rsquo; luck tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield turned his car around in the narrow
road, taking as long as he possibly could. Then
he swung open the rear door for the two men to
enter.</p>
<p>As Freeze settled himself, he gave Brad and Dan
a sharp glance, noticing their Scout uniforms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cubs!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Say, haven&rsquo;t I seen you
kids somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Brad answered. &ldquo;Unless
maybe it was in Webster City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cubs!&rdquo; the man repeated. &ldquo;Now I got it! Dobbs
was telling us that they were swarming over the
Silverton place and might make trouble&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo; Dan interposed innocently. &ldquo;What
sort of trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But neither Freeze nor his companion was to be
trapped into further speech.</p>
<p>Suddenly suspicious, they started to get out of
the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for offering a lift,&rdquo; Freeze muttered, &ldquo;but
we&rsquo;ll telephone for a tow car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield had observed the headlights of two
approaching vehicles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be necessary to telephone,&rdquo; he said with
quiet jubilation. &ldquo;I rather think help is coming now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as the Cub leader spoke, Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s car
drove up, followed by a police cruiser.</p>
<p>Freeze and Bauer, abandoning their luggage,
made a dash for the hill. Belatedly they realized
that they had fallen into a trap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>Mr. Silverton and Saul Dobbs had leaped from
the sportsman&rsquo;s car. Deliberately, they cut off
escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute!&rdquo; the owner of the pheasant farm
said, stepping in front of Freeze and Bauer. &ldquo;I have
a few questions to ask you two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as?&rdquo; Freeze demanded insolently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For one thing, I want to know why you&rsquo;ve been
shipping my pheasants out of town? And trespassing
on my property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; Freeze
muttered, trying without success to shove past the
sportsman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; about any pheasants,&rdquo;
Bauer added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you do,&rdquo; Mr. Silverton corrected. &ldquo;You
needn&rsquo;t deny that you&rsquo;ve been trespassing. Dobbs
already has confessed his part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you dirty double-crosser!&rdquo; Freeze accused,
starting for the workman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you for this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he could lay hands on Dobbs, he was
firmly grasped by a police officer who informed him
and Bauer that they both were under arrest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an outrage!&rdquo; Bauer protested bitterly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no evidence against us. Dobbs has been
telling lies to try to save his own skin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let the judge decide about that,&rdquo; the
policeman retorted. &ldquo;Come along without any fuss,
or we&rsquo;ll use the handcuffs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aware that resistance would be quite useless, the
two men sullenly submitted to arrest. They were
loaded into the police car and taken away.</p>
<p>Mr. Silverton then turned to express his appreciation
once more to the Cubs and their leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From now on, I want it understood that the
Cubs are free and welcome to come and go whenever
and wherever they please on my property,&rdquo;
he declared. &ldquo;And I want to help the Cub movement
here in Webster City. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll send the
organization a check for one hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s entirely too generous,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield protested.
&ldquo;After all, the Cubs only tried to do what
was right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s right that I should make the contribution,&rdquo;
insisted Mr. Silverton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d gladly pay double
the amount for the service the Cubs have rendered
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield, Brad and Dan, rather worn from
their adventures, followed the police cruiser and
Mr. Silverton&rsquo;s car into Webster City.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>In backtracking along the highway, they encountered
two extensive patches of flood water. However,
it rose only to hub-cap depth, and they reached
the city without further delay.</p>
<p>During the next two days, events moved with
supersonic speed for the Cubs. True to his word,
Mr. Silverton sent the organization a check for one
hundred dollars. With it came an urgent invitation
for the Cubs to visit the farm whenever they
wished, with exclusive right of obtaining pheasant
feathers or wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we all can make fancy Indian headgears
now!&rdquo; declared Fred enthusiastically.</p>
<p>From Mr. Silverton, the Cubs learned that both
Freeze and Bauer had pleaded guilty to stealing
pheasants and were to be sentenced on a larceny
charge within a few days. Dobbs, relieved of his job,
had left Webster City to seek employment where he
was unknown.</p>
<p>Now that their names had been cleared in the
community, the Cubs centered all their thoughts
upon the coming Pack meeting and exhibition of
handicraft articles.</p>
<p>All the Den members were plugging for Chips
and Red to win a prize with their entry. However,
on the night of the exhibition, when they saw the
many fine items entered by other contestants, they
were filled with misgiving.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>The collection of Indian articles was one of the
best ever shown in Webster City. In addition to
many elegant feather bonnets, there were buckskin
shirts, shields, Indian leggings, baskets, beaded
belts and carvings of bone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chips and Red have one of the best entries,&rdquo;
Brad told Dan after he had inspected all the items
on display. &ldquo;But they may not win a prize. That
buckskin shirt shows a lot of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the judges have gone back to look at it at
least three times,&rdquo; Dan agreed gloomily.</p>
<p>At last came the all important moment for the
awaited announcement of the contest winners.</p>
<p>Raising his hand in signal for silence, the Cub
master read off the names of minor prize winners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, the grand prize&mdash;the silver trophy
which will be awarded to the Den which entered
the over-all handicraft article deemed by the judges
to be the best.&rdquo; The Cub Master paused for effect
as all the Cubs waited tensely. Then he gazed directly
at Red and Chips and added: &ldquo;Den No. 2
wins the trophy with its entry of a pheasant feather
war bonnet!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>The Cubs let out a whoop which could be heard
half way across the river. Everyone clapped Red
and Chips on the shoulder, congratulating them on
their victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sure proud of you,&rdquo; Brad declared. &ldquo;And
of the trophy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you and Dan will win something yourselves,&rdquo;
Chips hinted broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we had no entries. Only a couple of Indian
bows which weren&rsquo;t any good. They didn&rsquo;t take any
prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; Chips chuckled.</p>
<p>The Pack meeting resumed, with Mr. Hatfield
telling the boys of his pride in their accomplishments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honor is a Cub&rsquo;s most precious possession,&rdquo; he
ended his little talk. &ldquo;And that brings me to an important
moment. The Cubs sincerely feel that had
it not been for the untiring efforts of two of our
members, the honor of the organization might have
been tarnished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if drawn by a magnet, all eyes now focused
upon Brad and Dan. The two boys shifted uneasily,
already beginning to feel uncomfortable. Their faces
were flushed with embarrassment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give &rsquo;em the Grand Howl!&rdquo; proposed Mr.
Hatfield.</p>
<p>Now as Brad and Dan knew well, the Grand
Howl was reserved only for distinguished guests or
individuals the Pack wished to honor.</p>
<p>Before they could protest, all the Cubs formed a
circle about the pair. Squatting down, each boy
made the familiar two-finger Cub sign. Then, like
young wolves, they gave a long and lusty howl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A-h-h&mdash;kay Laa! W-e-e-l d-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-r
Best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final word was yelled sharply and in unison.
Then the Cubs leaped to their feet in a double hand
salute, ending at attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad and Dan!&rdquo; Chips shouted boisterously,
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re tops in the gang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s to the Cubs!&rdquo; responded Dan, uttering
a wild yip of his own. &ldquo;Long may they howl!&rdquo;</p>
